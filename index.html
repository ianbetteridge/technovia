		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Grok, the AI part of X, got caught spinning responses in a way which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618109/grok-blocked-elon-musk-trump-misinformation">prevented it from surfacing posts which accused either Elon Musk or Donald Trump of spreading misinformation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Grok, Elon Musk’s ChatGPT competitor, temporarily refused to respond with “sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation,” according to xAI’s head of engineering, Igor Babuschkin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Babuschkin promptly claimed this was an error, throwing an unnamed engineer under the bus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In response to questions on X, Babuschkin said that Grok’s system prompt (the internal rules that govern how an AI responds to queries) is publicly visible “because we believe users should be able to see what it is we’re asking Grok.” He said “an employee pushed the change” to the system prompt “because they thought it would help, but this is obviously not in line with our values.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s two different ways of looking at this, and a lot will depend on how you feel about Musk and/or Twitter/X. The first is positive – that Grok (unlike every other LLM you can think of) publishes their system prompts and so there’s a much greater level of transparency.</p>
<p>However, this depends on you actually trusting Musk/X – and a lot of people don’t trust him more than they can throw him. After all, could this just be a case of something being revealed that shouldn’t, but that’s actually in use in a hidden set of prompts?</p>
<p>Giving Musk the benefit of the doubt feels unwise, given the fact he consistently lies or uses half-truths about almost everything, from his involvement in the founding of Tesla through to how many kids he has.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cruz&rsquo;s press release said that &ldquo;unlike in a classroom or study hall, off-premises hotspot use is not typically supervised, inviting exposure to inappropriate content, including social media.&rdquo; Cruz&rsquo;s office alleged that the FCC program shifts control of Internet access from parents to schools and thus &ldquo;heightens the risk of censoring kids' exposure to conservative viewpoints.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has there ever been a clearer demonstration that conservatives believe only their viewpoints should be allowed? Putting forward any other opinion is, apparently, &ldquo;censorship&rdquo;. In the sense that the truth is &ldquo;censoring&rdquo; lies, I suppose.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rather than buy another smartwatch, Migicovsky decided to try and get Pebble going again. He sold his most recent startup, a messaging app called Beeper, to Automattic last year and left the company in the fall. Since then, he’d thought about starting a Pebble-like product from scratch, figuring it’d be easier to do the same thing again a second time. “But then I was like, what if I just asked Google to open-source the operating system?” he says. It felt like a long shot, but he knew the code was just sitting dormant inside Mountain View somewhere. So he asked. A few times.To Migicovsky’s surprise, Google agreed to release Pebble OS to the public. As of Monday, all the Pebble firmware is available on GitHub, and Migicovsky is starting a company to pick up where he left off.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://goodallandgoodluck.substack.com/p/trumps-new-age-of-acquiesence">Lewis Goodall is really on point with this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is how Trumpism is best understood. It is about the free expression of power, without hindrance, even over our collective understanding. And this week, it reached a new apex: Trump wants the power to shape not only the present, but the past, history itself. That is how the pardoning of the January 6th insurrectionists should be seen. There was much speculation that Trump might only pardon some, not all of those impriosned, to leave some of the most egregious offenders, including those literally caught on film violently assaulting police officers. But he is said to have told his team to “fuck it. Release them all.” This wasn’t just about rewarding his people, though it is truly chilling to consider that he has released his own de facto paramilitary force, loyal entirely to himself, highly armed, precisely at the moment he takes away the state security provided to a whole host of his enemies. It’s about something deeper: about history and how we understand it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In releasing everyone, the message he sends is that his narrative of January 6th is the correct one- that these were minor incidents. That we did not see what we saw, that we cannot believe our own eyes. This coincides with the new Congress, at Trump’s behest, investigating not the Jan6th insurrectionists, but the Congressional committee which investigated them. He and his allies have been spreading conspiracies about what happened at the Capitol for years. The pardons are the final coup de grace: Nothing could have happened because no crimes occurred. It was all just a liberal, Democratic confection, like everything else. As Orwell said, &ldquo;Who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.&rdquo; In effect, Trump pardoned himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As part of other efforts to balance budgets, 28% of councils said they expected to sell off existing housing stock, while 45% are already using reserves to cover day-to-day spending. Of the 76 councils, 71 highlighted at least one sign of financial stress over housing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the worst legacies of the Thatcherite era was the sell-off of council housing. While it meant that council tenants could get on &ldquo;the property ladder&rdquo;, the law prevented councils from reinvesting the money in new housing, which meant that stock ran down over time. Add in the horrible squeeze on council funding of the austerity era and you get a toxic brew that will take Labour a decade to sort out.</p>

			 <p>Most Mac users of a certain age remember Power Computing, the Mac cloner who undercut Apple with better machines back in the mid-90s. Apple ended up buying Power Computing out and putting an end to the clone market. Well if you can&rsquo;t compete, use your financial muscle.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s often said that Apple bought the company – but it didn&rsquo;t. Even Wikipedia gets this wrong, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Computing_Corporation#Acquisition_by_Apple">claiming that Power was an Apple subsidiary</a>. In fact, what Apple bought was the Mac-related assets of Power, including the license to make Mac clones. Apple did not acquire the company.</p>
<p>And, in fact, Power had a brief life post-Apple acquisition. It <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/power-turns-attention-to-intel/">attempted to launch an Intel-based Windows laptop, the PowerTrip</a>. However, it seems to have run out of money before it could launch – at least I can&rsquo;t find any references to anyone ever getting their hands on the PowerTrip – and it <a href="https://www.techmonitor.ai/technology/power_computing_axes_150_jobs_and_faces_42m_lawsuit">got sued by its suppliers</a>.</p>
<p>By the end of January 1998, <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/week/013098power.html">Power was gone</a>. Ironically, if the company had survived for longer, the $100m in Apple stock would have been worth a lot, lot more than Power itself ever was or could have been.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure that somewhere in a box, I still have some of their stickers.</p>

<p>A long, long post by Ed Zitron which fires both barrels at Meta, reloads, fires at Casey Newton specifically, reloads <em>again</em> and fires at the tech media in general. And at least on the first point (and definitely the third) I think he&rsquo;s entirely right. Meta&rsquo;s platforms have <em>consistently</em> promoted right wing talking points, and the tech media spent nearly two decades largely cheerleading odious people like Zuckerberg.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact, many of the controversial moderation calls Facebook made in the pandemic were during the Trump administration. Take, for instance, the “Plandemic” video hoax: Facebook removed the video in 2020. Joe Biden took office in 2021. If Zuckerberg was dealing with an administration pressuring him about this, it was the Trump administration. The Biden White House may well have engaged in similar outreach, but it was joining what was already an active discussion about Facebook moderation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mullenweg on Sunday published a blog post claiming that WP Engine’s lawsuit against him and Automattic is an attempt to “curtail” his “First Amendment rights.” He wrote: “WP Engine has filed hundreds pages of legal documents seeking an injunction against me and Automattic. They say this about community or some nonsense, but if you look at the core, what they’re trying to do is ask a judge to curtail my First Amendment rights.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Mullenweg ended the post by stating he will no longer comment on the lawsuit filed by WP Engine but encouraged others to speak up in support of his side of the dispute.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mullenweg ended his post because his lawyers have finally managed to make him stop saying boneheading things which act only to strengthen WPEngine&rsquo;s case. And because of that, he&rsquo;s sulking and claiming the whole thing violates his free speech rights.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s the betting he comes out for Trump at some point?</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/elon-musk-election-misinformation-trump-dominion-rcna176096">Opinion | I ran Twitter’s civic integrity team. Elon Musk knows nothing about how elections are run.</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Musk also called it “weird” that Dominion voting machines were supposedly uncommon in much of the country, but used in key precincts like Philadelphia and Arizona’s Maricopa County. “Doesn’t that seem like a heck of a coincidence?” he asked.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer is “no,” because this “coincidence” is a myth. First, Musk’s implication that Dominion Voting Systems has technology only in strategically important locations is easily disprovable. The voting technology marketplace in the U.S. is in fact highly concentrated, and Dominion is one of the top two vendors in the U.S., with a market share of approximately 40%. There is no basis to suggest that Dominion has somehow cherry-picked only strategic jurisdictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m unsure whether Musk is so incredibly off the charts dense that he will believe anything he reads online, or he just doesn&rsquo;t care even slightly about the truth as long as what he wants to happen &ndash; a government by Trump, which is pliable to his will - happens.</p>
<p>One of the things which makes me believe he&rsquo;s incredibly stupid is that is he had any knowledge of history, he would know that when you elect an authoritarian demagogue &ndash; which is what Trump is &ndash; they very rarely fail to bite the hands of those who brought them to power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I became a blogger because of Dave.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in a sense, did I. The first blogging platform I used was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_UserLand">Radio Userland</a>, which Dave created. I moved on to web-based blogging applications — first Blogger, I think, then Movable Type — but Radio Userland made it easy.</p>
<p>But my use of Dave&rsquo;s software goes back even further. Back when I worked at Apple UK in the late 80s, the company had a site license for <a href="%5Ben.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE...%5D(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MORE_(application))">MORE</a>, the outliner/presentation package which Dave also wrote. MORE was great because it made it super-easy to build your ideas using an outline and then turn them into something visual. It was a mile ahead of anything else, and conceptually I still prefer that method of building a presentation to the “visuals first” approach of PowerPoint.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is nearly impossible to get me to feel sympathetic for anything touched by private equity, but Mullenweg has done just that. He really is burning all goodwill for reasons I cannot quite understand. I do understand the message he is sending, though: Mullenweg is prepared to use the web’s most popular CMS and any third-party contributions as his personal weapon. Your carefully developed plugin is not safe in the WordPress ecosystem if you dare cross him or Automattic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nick&rsquo;s post really speaks to the level of exasperation many are feeling about this situation. The disagreement between WordPress &ndash; which means Matt Mullenweg &ndash; and WP Engine has managed to burn a huge amount of goodwill towards WordPress. You don&rsquo;t get to build open-source software and use it (as Nick puts it) &ldquo;as your personal weapon&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mullenweg&rsquo;s conduct isn&rsquo;t just dangerous to WordPress, it&rsquo;s a danger to the entire open-source community. And what&rsquo;s most worrying: he apparently can&rsquo;t see it. He keeps escalating and escalating, and it will not end well for his company or for WordPress as a product.</p>

<p>Amazon is taking this a step further by <!-- raw HTML omitted -->using generative AI to do product recommendations on site<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Given that a large number of searches for products begin on Amazon anyway, this is more bad news for anyone who makes money from sending traffic towards the Seattle company. And as users get more and more exposed to using conversation to hone down what they want, this is going to get worse for publishers who focus on “an article” as the canonical way of recommending products.</p>
<p>The truth is that articles have never been brilliant at recommending the right solution for any individual. For example, the answer to “what car is right for me” has always depended on your use of it. Conversational agents using good quality data will be a better solution in the long run.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But a big chunk of the internet runs on WordPress. Publishers use it a lot. It’s become the IBM of web servers: “no one ever got fired for recommending WordPress”. And the hold-outs in the publishing space who have had their own bespoke software or used something else appear to be dwindling every year.</p>
<p>So WordPress <!-- raw HTML omitted -->matters<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, to a degree that few other software platforms do. It became popular in part because it was open source, so anyone could customize it and bend it to their will, and because so many people used it that it was easy to support and find developers for. It saw off semi-forgotten closed source rivals.</p>
<p>If you want a summary then <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mathew Ingram’s article is a good place to go<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Mathew has written something which encapsulates the feeling that I think many people have: profound disappointment in Mat Mullenweg’s behaviour, in his refusal to understand that being both the CEO of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the effective owner of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> places him in a position which needs to be handled sensitively. Using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->WordPress.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to attack a commercial rival of his company means it “now looks like the CEO of a multibillion-dollar corporation is using his control of a theoretically open-source foundation to extort money from a competitor.” That is unacceptable.</p>

<p>I’m as guilty of this as the next nerd, but at least I’m aware of my addiction. It’s one of the reasons why I have spent time avoiding getting sucked into the word of Notion, because I can see myself losing days (weeks) to tinkering, all the while getting nothing done.</p>
<p>That said, if you are going to create an entire workflow management system and you’re in the word of Apple, you could do a lot worse than <!-- raw HTML omitted -->take a leaf out of Joan Westenberg’s book and use all Apple’s first party apps<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. They have now got to the point where they are superficially simple, but contain a lot of power underneath.</p>
<p>The downside is it’s an almost certain way of trapping yourself in Apple’s ecosystem for the rest of time. Yes, Apple’s services – which lie behind the apps – use standards and have the ability to export, but not all of them, and for how long?</p>
<p>It’s a trade off, and from my perspective not one that really works for me right now. But if it does for you, then it’s a good option (and better than Notion).</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Why is this problematic? Because it’s setting Apple up as a judge in a legal case. YouTube could, and should, have gone to a judge if it believed it had a legal case for trademark violation. That’s what judges are for. Instead, probably because it knew that it wouldn’t win a case like that, it went to Apple. Apple (rightly) doesn’t want to get involved in trademark disputes, so it shrugged and removed the app.</p>
<p>This extra-legal application of law is one of the most nefarious impacts of App Store monopolies. And if it continues to be allowed, it will only get worse.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The whole thing has brought out the worst in Mullenweg, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as evidenced in his attacks on Kellie Peterson<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Peterson, who is a former Automattic employee, offered to help anyone leaving WordPress find opportunities. Mullenweg decided this was attacking him, and claimed this was illegal. I don’t know about you, but when a multi-millionaire starts to throw around words like “tortuous interference” I pay attention.</p>
<p>As with many of that generation of California ideologists Mullenweg appears to have decided that he knows best, now and always. Yes, private equity companies that use open source projects and contribute nothing back are douchebags, but they’re douchebags who are doing something that the principles of open source explicitly allow them to do. Mullenweg’s apparent desire to be the emperor of WordPress is worrying.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think Ed’s right — and it’s important to note, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->as Satya Nadella did<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, that LLMs are moving into the “commodity” stage — but one other thing to note is that many of the more simple things which people use LLMs for are being pushed from cloud to edge. Apple’s “Apple Intelligence” is one example of this, but Microsoft is also pushing a lot of the compute down to the device level in the ARM-based Copilot PCs.</p>
<p>This trend should alleviate some of the growth issues that OpenAI has, but it’s a double-edged sword because it makes it less likely that someone will need to use ChatGPT, and so even less likely to need to pay OpenAI.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And the point is: sometimes it’s fine not to be subtle. Sometimes it’s fine to be overblown. Sometimes the story demands it, like a steak needs to be juicy.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To be clear: I think Mozilla’s goals are laudable, in the sense that at the moment the choice for people is either accept being tracked to a horrendous degree or just block almost every ad and tracker. But you can’t engineer your way around the advertising industry’s rapacious desire for data. It’s that industry which needs to change, not the technology.</p>

<p>Anyway, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Reeder<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has been one of my favourite Mac and iOS applications for a long time. It’s an RSS reader (the clue is in the name) that’s a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->beautiful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> piece of design.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Silvio Rizzo<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, its author, has rebuilt the app from the ground up to change its focus and, as he puts it, make it something that’s “rebuilt for today”.</p>
<p>What does that mean? The starting point is that the way we get information is no longer all about RSS. In fact, we get feeds from social media, from YouTube, from podcasts, and many other places.</p>
<p>So Reeder now supports all of the above, putting everything into a single feed. It’s still a lovely design, but I suspect this approach won’t be for everyone. It reminds me of the “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->river of news<!-- raw HTML omitted -->” concept that Dave Winer was talking about more than a decade ago. I’m not sure if I like it yet, but I am going to give it a go.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But it’s had one small weakness which means I don’t use it for as much as I would want: it’s not really designed to handle long-form articles made up from smaller pieces, whether that’s a novel or book-length project of just something composed from small parts. It can do transclusion in writing, and that’s a useful feature, but it’s not quite what I need.</p>
<p>A case in point: although the tools I use to write these linkblog posts vary, I often use Ulysses for it. I will write each of the ten blue links in a separate document, allowing me to go as short or long as I want without distraction. Then I just number them, move them into the right order, and publish direct to Wordpress.</p>
<p>I can’t quite do that with iA Writer — yet. I could create each document separately, but in order to make a single document which I could publish in one click, I would have to create a document, use the transclusion feature to “insert” all the elements, and publish it. It’s just a little less elegant than the same process on Ulysses.</p>
<p>The good news is that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it’s moving closer to having the right tools for the job<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. The latest version includes a “tree view” for files in its sidebar, making it significantly easier to structure texts. I’m really looking forward to what they do next.</p>

			 <p>I could &ndash; and probably should &ndash; write an entire essay about the cult of the founder in Silicon Valley, how it developed and the damage it has done. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This article from Dave Karpf<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, though, encapsulates some of my own thinking. Contrasting Aaron Swartz and Sam Altman &ndash; both members of the first Ycombinator cohort &ndash; is such an interesting approach.</p>
<p>But the other reason why <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the whole founder mode thing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a hot mess is that Paul Graham is entirely wrong about management and leadership. Yeah, I know: Graham has been involved with building more companies than I have. But he&rsquo;s never actually run, or even been in a senior leadership role, in a large company.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a key paragraph in his essay which I think shows this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Another tell on Graham&rsquo;s lack of experience in this area: his lack of knowledge that companies other than Steve Jobs' Apple run annual retreats for the 100 most influential people, regardless of level. As Karpf notes, many companies do this. Heck, I have been part of retreats like that even at old-school publishing companies.</p>
<p>But if you have never worked in large companies, and you have the kind of founder myopia that Graham has, you wouldn&rsquo;t know that.</p>
<p>I think Dave gets it right when he connects founder mode with other Silicon Valley craziness:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that people themselves are getting boring: it&rsquo;s that the landscape and characters in tech coverage have become more one dimensional. The hype cycle driven by characters like Graham often feels like you are being bludgeoned around the head if you&rsquo;re not &ldquo;all in&rdquo; on crypto, or the metaverse, or LLMs, or whatever.</p>
<p>And the personalities &ndash; and tech is, and always has been, as much about people as things &ndash; are cartoon villains/heroic founders (delete as appropriate) who live in a bubble of their own. Musk, Graham, Altman… you name it.</p>
<p>Tech has become all Jobs and no Woz. As Dave Karpf rightly identifies, the hacker has vanished from the scene, to be replaced by an endless array of know-nothing hero founders whose main superpower is the ability to bully subordinates (and half of Twitter) into believing they are always right.</p>
<p>Where the hackers exist, they are either buried in the depths of big companies (does Johny Srouji ever leave that pristine basement?) or working on interesting but niche open source projects, often involving writing yet another text editor.</p>
<p>In allowing and encouraging the likes of Graham to define what tech looks like, we have made tech look boring, unless you are the kind of teenage who dreams of getting rich quick by starting a company, riding a hype cycle, and flipping it to some sucker for a few hundred million.</p>
<p>I doubt that commentators who love technology are bored with tech. But I do think we are bored with blow hards like Graham being the centre of attention, of hype cycles, and of huge corporations that are more interested in boosting revenues through digging moats and buying off potential competition.</p>
<p>Perhaps what Neil is detecting isn&rsquo;t boredom, but dismay. If you lived through the excitement of the 80s and 90s, and the web optimism of the 00s, it&rsquo;s difficult to look at people like Graham &ndash; people who aren&rsquo;t as bright as they think they are &ndash; and get excited about the future of the industry.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Steve Jobs who went back to Apple was a different person from the one that left it, chastened by the experience of business failure. It’s an interesting question of parallel history but my thought is that had Jobs won the battle and remained CEO rather than Sculley, the kind of mistakes that he made with NeXT would have probably lead to Apple suffering the same fate as most of the early computer makers who didn’t move to DOS/Windows.</p>

			 <p>First of all, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how the hell is it June already?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Is it just me? Is time passing at a ludicrously fast pace?</p>
<p>OK, maybe it is just me.</p>
<p>This week was, in work terms, truncated: A bank holiday plus a day off on Thursday made the week feel even shorter than normal. Since Thursday I have been up in Suffolk for a little mini-gathering of the clan, seeing my niece, her husband, and their two lovely children – the children for the first time ever. They all live over in Adelaide, where my brother and his wife settled over thirty years ago. An outpost of the Betteridge’s, established.</p>
<p>Because I’m quite a bit younger than my siblings being a great-uncle has come pretty early. I’m less than 20 years older than my youngest niece, which means we share quite a few cultural references, probably more than my siblings in some ways. And my niece’s lovely husband (who once managed to absolutely charm my mother, which gives him bonus points) is a wonderful, lovely guy, too.</p>
<p>Spending time away from home is good, but I’m less enamoured of living out of a rucksack than perhaps I would have been twenty years ago. I love being away, but the prospect of being at home in my own bed is what makes travelling special. The journey may indeed be the reward, but being able to soak in my own bath for a couple of hours is also part of the journey, in a way.</p>
<p>This week I have been reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beyond the light horizon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Ken Macleod, the third in a series which I have quite enjoyed. It’s a nice near-future romp which features submarines which are actually spaceships, a mysterious alien intelligence, and a European Union that’s developed into a more communistic union – and which works better. Thank you Ken for painting a picture of a near future that’s not totally wrecked. I enjoyed the first volume a lot, thought the second lagged a little (as second volumes often do) and am enjoying the third one a lot more so far.</p>
<p>This week I also bought a new iPad, the 11in iPad Pro with the spangly new M4 chip in it. As a bit of background, I actually had two iPads: an M1 12.9in, and a recent iPad mini. Since I bought the MacBook Air M2, the 12.9 – which was intended to be my travelling machine – has hardly had much use. The 11in iPad Pro is intended to replace both, and be the device I take on trips and while commuting.</p>
<p>This trip to Suffolk was its first journey, and it’s done really well. The new keyboard is a delight to type on. While I didn’t mind the previous Magic Keyboard, this is a far better feel and more akin to the excellent MacBook Air keyboard. It’s also – of course – a great book reader, and I have spent a lot of time reading on it. The screen is great, but honestly the screen on every iPad I have ever owned has been great. Is it noticeably better than the older iPad Pro? Not to my old eyes, but that’s because the older iPad Pros already had great screens.</p>
<p>More importantly battery life is good, largely (I think) thanks to the shift to OLED and the power-sipping qualities of the M4. Does it need all that power? No. Will there be applications in the future where it’s required? Almost certainly. Roll on WWDC in a few weeks.</p>

			 <p>What a weird week. You might have noticed Microsoft had a few announcements. I&rsquo;m not going to dwell on them – but what I will say is that moving AI from the cloud to the device while preserving privacy is hard, but a lot easier than keeping AI in the cloud. And so to the links…</p>

<p>Meta is probably one of the more agreeable players in this racket, too. It hoards data; it does not share much of it. And it has a brand to protect. Data brokers are far worse because nobody knows who they are or what they collect, share, and merge.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a point that I have made in the past: while the big companies like Meta get a lot of attention (and rightly so) data brokers further down the advertising food chain do a <em>lot, lot worse things.</em> That&rsquo;s not to say &ldquo;do nothing about Meta&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s an important point to note.</p>

			 <p>BOY that was a week. You might have noticed that I didn’t write a weeknote last weekend… well there’s lots of things going on at the moment that I can’t really talk about too much. I’ll no doubt have more to say about that some time soon, but in the meantime it just means that my time has been a bit fractured.</p>
<p>This week also saw me start a new job, as interim head of content at Russell Publishing. Russell – or RPL as everyone calls it internally – is a business to business publisher going through some change, and I’ve been brought on board to help develop some new content strategies and mentor the content team. I’m going to be with them for nine months, which I think should be enough to get the job done, and I’m only doing four days a week so I can continue to have enough time to work on some fiction and some other small projects.</p>
<p>It was slightly odd being back in a business environment after a few months where my time was basically my own. I’m only in the office two days a week (the company is staunchly hybrid, which is good) but it’s the first time for several months that I’ve been working around people like that.</p>
<p>To make things more fun, after my first day in the office – induction on Monday – I came home feeling really under the weather, shivering and aching, so I had to phone in sick on Tuesday. Great start! Not QUITE how I wanted things to go. But we go again this week, and it was nice to meet my direct reports.</p>

<p>Antitrust cases are just wonderful for journalists. When Microsoft was going through its cases with the DOJ and European Commission, back in the late 90s and early 00s, I spent quite a bit of time writing about it. So it seemed natural to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->write something which drew on that experience<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in terms of the expectations of the kind of stuff you’re going to read and the process it will go through.</p>

Walt is one of my technology journalism heroes.

<p>Apart from some annoying typos and unpleasant formatting (Platt is self publishing the ebook versions) it’s well worth the couple of quid each one will set you back. Everyone is in here, from Asimov and Clarke to members of the New Wave. Even L Ron Hubbard is there.</p>

<p>In other words, how much is it okay for a first party to advantage themselves over third parties? If there is a line, where should it be, and who should establish it? There is obviously deep resistance to government intervention among the industry and its commentators, but there is also little incentive for operating system vendors to restrain themselves from prioritizing their own products and services. Gates, at this time, could not articulate any reason why Microsoft should not follow any competitive path it chose, even if that meant doing things third-party developers could not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that, of course, is exactly where Apple is now. What limits would Apple set themselves? There are none, that I can see.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/apple_epic_developer_account">Daring Fireball: Apple Terminated Epic’s E.U. Developer Account</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess Epic is implying that the EU government, not Apple, should have that discretion? They don’t say so, but who else but Apple could have that discretion? But the European Commission isn’t set up for that sort of police work. That’s not how the EC works. The DMA doesn’t say that the EC now runs app marketplaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, regulating markets is <em>exactly</em> the thing that the European Union is set up to do &ndash; the foundation of the EU as a whole is the Single Market, and anything which threatens to fragment the single market into something smaller, under private control, is to be resisted at all costs.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/facing-reality-in-the-eu-and-tech/">Baldur Bjarnason put it in an excellent post recently</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much like roaming, App Stores let private companies subdivide and control the single market to their own financial gain. When much of the digital economy is taking place on phones, tablets, and various other devices that are largely limited to App Stores, this is effectively ceding the single market to a fragmented market that’s entirely under corporate control. This is against the core operating theory behind the EU.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Apple isn&rsquo;t getting is this isn&rsquo;t something that the EU is going to roll over for. As Baldur also notes, this is explicit in the naming and intention of the Digital Markets Act &ndash; whenever you see the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; in EU regulation it&rsquo;s a tell that the intention is to bring an area into the scope of the single market, when the EU believes it has been out of alignment.</p>
<p>Regulating markets isn&rsquo;t just a small thing for the EU. It&rsquo;s existential. As Baldur puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Apple, the App Store is a side line. To the EU, the single market is the foundation of its existence. Any time you see two entities of similar size fight, bet on the one that thinks it’s fighting for its life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, John mentions that Spotify has been as publicly-critical of Apple as Epic, and it hasn&rsquo;t had its developer account revoked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spotify, for example, is just as vociferous a corporate critic of the App Store as Epic is, and Apple hasn’t threatened them with revocation of Spotify’s developer program membership. The difference between Spotify and Epic isn’t in their rhetoric; it’s in their past behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s another key difference: revoking Spotify would be a much bigger deal, both practically and politically. Spotify has around <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/music-streaming-stats">a third of all streaming music users</a>, double its nearest competitor &ndash; which happens to be Apple. Spotify has 226 million paying subscribers, and a lot of them will use iPhones. Being told they can no longer use their Spotify account would undoubtedly mean that next upgrade cycle some of them would choose to move to Android.</p>
<p>The politics would also be terrible. Using your power over a market to ban the number one service where you are number two is exactly the kind of move which would land Apple in a world of legal pain. By comparison, banning Epic was nothing.</p>
<p>The level of bad behaviour that Spotify would have to get up to in order to Apple to ban them would have to be so egregious, obvious and public that ignoring it imposed a bigger cost than removing their developer status. I&rsquo;m not sure what that might be. Given that Apple never ever blinked when <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/">Facebook was complicit in genocide</a>, I can&rsquo;t imagine what Spotify would need to do to get banned. Launch its own nuclear weapons? Despite Apple&rsquo;s protestations, the rules of the App Store game are very different for developers that are strategically important to Apple.</p>
<p>Why is Apple, a company that&rsquo;s not exactly composed of <a href="https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Golgafrinchan_Ark_Fleet_Ship_B">B-Ark players</a>, getting this so wrong? I wonder about this a lot. In my professional life, I&rsquo;ve known a lot of people at Apple. I worked there for a short time. I was in daily contact with them while working on <em>MacUser</em>. 99.99% of those I&rsquo;ve met have been good, smart people. Some of them are still friends.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m certain the same is true for John, and I would, not that long ago, have posed a very similar question to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But why not take an opportunity to look magnanimous? Apple shouldn’t be expected to grovel, but this looks like they’re <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1765431238985187525?s=20">going out of their way to look vindictive</a>. I really thought it would be a clever bit of public relations jujitsu to make nice with Epic, even if, in Cupertino, it was through gritted teeth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the answer to this lies in a gradual change I&rsquo;ve seen in the way the company behaves since (and I hate saying this) Steve Jobs died. In her recent <em>Burn Book</em>, Kara Swisher cites something that Jobs said to her:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2010, Apple’s market valuation would surpass Microsoft’s, a major milestone. A week later, Jobs was back on the ATD stage and I asked him if he had a thought or two about that. “For those of us who have been in the industry a long time, it’s surreal,” he responded. “But it’s not why any of our customers buy our product. Remember what we’re doing and why we’re doing it. Sometimes you just have to pick the things that look like they’re going to be the right horses moving forward. We’re trying to make great products. Have courage of our convictions … Customers pay us to make those choices. If we succeed, they’ll buy them, and if we don’t, they won’t.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jobs loved making money as much as the next billionaire, but not for the usual reasons. He didn&rsquo;t regard it as a measure of him, personally. It was a measure of how much people loved Apple products, because they chose to buy the best. And when making products, the question of what delivered the best for the customer was always at the heart of decisions.</p>
<p>Apple today sees the App Store, too, as a product. It regards its role as delivering the best experience for customers, by keeping out crap apps, setting standards, making sure customers aren&rsquo;t ripped off, and so on.</p>
<p>Which leads me back, again, to the last line of that Jobs quote: &ldquo;Customers pay us to make those choices. If we succeed, they’ll buy them, and if we don’t, they won’t.&rdquo; Jobs knew that the pressure of competition was what kept Apple &ndash; and all companies &ndash; honest.</p>
<p>With the App Store, customers aren&rsquo;t allowed to choose. Apple doesn&rsquo;t compete by being the best. Apple succeeds by <strong>being the only option</strong> &ndash; and that is corrosive to any company culture. My fear that it&rsquo;s corroded Apple&rsquo;s culture, too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple has performed a screeching U-turn on killing web apps, perhaps because the European Commission publicly stated there was no need for Apple to scrap them in the first place. Oh dear. I look forward to certain (mostly US) commentators retracting their “the bad and evil EU is forcing our beloved Apple to do a bad thing” stance and replacing it with a “the bad and evil EU is making it impossible for Apple to know what it should do and that is a bad thing” stance. Fun!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ability of US-based Apple commentators to both fail to understand how the EU works and make so many excuses for the company&rsquo;s bad behaviour is really quite a thing.</p>

<p>As he says, it is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> weird going to a 16in laptop after using a 13in one – I dusted off my 16in 2019 MacBook Pro a couple of days ago to keep it updated and make sure I has all my files on it<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and it makes using the Air feel like you’re using a toy computer. It also reminds me how much better the keyboard on the Air is – the MBP was, I think, part of the last generation of Macs before Apple dropped their terrible switches.</p>
<p>Like John, I also find myself using USB-C to charge the Air rather than the MagSafe port. I don’t get the love for MagSafe. Sure, if you trip over the cable you have a chance with USB-C to remove your laptop from whatever surface it’s on, but on the few occasions I have kicked a cable the USB-C has come out anyway. Maybe other people’s tables are more slippery than mine? And anyway – with battery life like the M-series machines have, my Air mainly gets charged overnight. It’s really rare I bother plugging it in during the day<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->2<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>And I entirely agree with him about this, too:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple has also confirmed that it will charge a commission on purchases made through alternative payment platforms. This commission will be 12% for developers who are a member of the App Store Small Business Program and 27% for other apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The commission will apply to “purchases made within seven days after a user taps on an External Purchase Link and continues from the system disclosure sheet to an external website.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apple had a chance to turn a legal defeat into a long-term victory. With Google charging 26% in the same circumstances, the company could have adopted rules which dramatically reduced the levy it wants to take, say to 12% for all developers. This would have gained the company a lot of credibility over the long term.</p>
<p>But no. Instead, it chose to protect short-term revenue, and do something which looks petty, hostile to the developers who have made iOS a successful platform, and which will probably end up in court, again.</p>
<p>When it comes to antitrust, perception matters. And sadly for them, in that area, Apple never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of those new technologies that&rsquo;s useful primarily as a viewfinder on a dismal present and a future determined to be even more miserable. Nobody anywhere will like the smart carts. Nobody, anywhere, will find them not-obnoxious. Everybody who does more than a couple of moments of thinking about it will be horrified by the idea of humanity digging gigantic devastating holes in the ailing planet and mining out its contents for the purpose of putting tablet computers onto grocery carts so that they can perform a service repulsive to literally everyone. Nobody—nobody nobody nobody!—wants to live in a society characterized by inescapable omnipresent advertising for consumer products; no one yet born has yearned to have video advertisements take up ever more of their field of vision.</p>

<p>A $999 laptop that maxes out at 256 GB of storage and has a 1536 × 1024 display — yeah, I’m wondering why this exists in 2023, too. And I’m no longer wondering why Panos Panay left Microsoft for Amazon.</p>

<p>Not to say that the Surface Laptop 3 is any good &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t &ndash; but Microsoft isn&rsquo;t the only company that has some bizarre pricing at the &ldquo;low&rdquo; end of its laptop range.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/211-regulating-ai-by-executive-order?r=evw8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">Regulating AI by Executive Order is the Real AI Risk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The President’s Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence is a premature and pessimistic political solution to unknown technical problems and a clear case of regulatory capture at a time when the world would be best served by optimism and innovation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sinofsky&rsquo;s response is fairly typical of the AI boosters, and as always, it fails to understand the point of regulation. And in particular it fails to understand why an executive order is entirely the correct approach at this point.</p>
<p>Regulation exists so that we gain the benefits of something while ameliorating the risks. To use an area that probably makes sense to Americans, we regulate guns, so we get the benefits of them (personal protection, national security) while avoiding the dangers (everyone having a gun tends to lead to lots and plenty of gun deaths).</p>
<p>AI is the same: we should regulate AI to ameliorate the dangers of it. Now, those dangers aren&rsquo;t Terminators stomping around the world with machine guns. They are, instead, things like racial discrimination because of an intrinsic bias of algorithms. It&rsquo;s looking at the implications for privacy of generative AI being able to perfectly impersonate a person. It&rsquo;s the legal questions of accountability – if an AI makes a major error which leads to death, for example, who exactly is responsible?</p>
<p>But hey, I guess <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/opinion/marc-andreessen-reactionary-futurism.html">tech ethics is the enemy</a>, right?</p>
<p>So why an EO? In part, I think the AI boosters only have themselves to blame. You can&rsquo;t go around saying that AI is the most transformative technology since the invention of the PC and stoking the stock markets by claiming the impact will all be in the next couple of years and not be surprised if a government uses the tools it has to act expeditiously. Silicon Valley types constantly laugh at the slowness of the Federal government. Complaining when it does something quickly seems a bit rich. “Move fast and break stuff” sure – but not when it&rsquo;s their gigantic wealth that might be the thing that gets broken.</p>
<p>Sinofsky also highlights the nay-sayers of the past, including posting some pictures of books which drew attention to the dangers of computers. The problem is some of those books are turning out to be correct: David Burnham&rsquo;s <em>The Rise of the Computer State</em> looks pretty prescient in a world of ubiquitous surveillance where governments are encouraging police forces to make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/29/uk-police-urged-to-double-use-of-facial-recognition-software">more use of facial recognition software</a>, even though <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-65214494">it discriminates against minorities</a> because it finds it hard to recognise black faces. Arthur R. Miller may have been on to something, too, when he titled his book <em>The Assault on Privacy</em>.</p>
<p>Sinofsky gets to the heart of what ails him in a single paragraph:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section I of the EO says it all right up front. This is not a document about innovation. It is about stifling innovation. It is not about fostering competition or free markets but about controlling them a priori. It is not about regulating known problems but preventing problems that don’t yet exist from existing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I would respond: &ldquo;great! It&rsquo;s about time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a myth in Silicon Valley that innovation is somehow an unalloyed good which must always be protected and should never be regulated, lest we stop some world-shaking discovery. It doesn&rsquo;t take 20 seconds of thinking – or even any understanding of history – to see that&rsquo;s not true. Yes, experimentation is how we learn, how we discover new things which benefit us all. But there are no spheres of knowledge outside possibly the humanities where that is completely unregulated. If you want to do nuclear research, good look with getting a permit to run your experimental reactor in the middle of a city. If you would like to do experimental chemistry, you&rsquo;re going to be on the wrong side of the law if you do it in your garage.</p>
<p>All of those things “stifle innovation”. All of them are entirely justified. Given the world-changing hype – created by technology business people – around AI, they really should get used to a little stifling too.</p>
<p>As for the idea that this is “preventing product(s) that don&rsquo;t exist from existing”… that is precisely what we pay our taxes to do. We spend billions on defence to prevent the problem of someone dropping big bombs on our cities. We pay for education, so we won&rsquo;t have the problem of a stupid population which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump">votes in a charlatan</a> in the future (why do you think the far right hates education?)</p>
<p>Good business leaders talk all the time about how proactive action prevents costly issues in the future. They scan horizons, and act decisively and early to make sure their businesses survive. The idea that the government should only <em>react</em>, especially when that&rsquo;s usually too late, is just bizarre.</p>
<p>At one point, Sinofsky&rsquo;s sings the praises of science fiction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best, enduring, and most thoughtful writers who most eloquently expressed the fragility and risks of technology also saw technology as the answer to forward progress. They did not seek to pre-regulate the problems but to innovate our way out of problems. In all cases, we would not have gotten to the problems on display without the optimism of innovation. There would be no problem with an onboard computer if the ship had already not traveled the far reaches of the universe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a mark of the Silicon Valley mind-set that he appears to forget the understandable point that <em>this was all made up stuff.</em> 2001 wasn&rsquo;t real. Star Trek was not real.</p>
<p>Sinofsky then spends some time arguing that the government isn&rsquo;t “compelled” to act, as AI is actually not moving that quickly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter how fast you believe AI is advancing, it is not advancing at the exponential rates we saw in microprocessors as we all know today as Moore’s Law or the growth of data storage that made database technology possible, or the number of connected nodes on the internet starting in 1994 due to the WWW and browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All well and good, but not true: <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252475371/Stanford-University-finds-that-AI-is-outpacing-Moores-Law">a Stanford study from 2019</a> found that AI computational power was advancing <em>faster</em> than processor development, and that was before the massive boost from the current AI frenzy. <a href="https://www.alger.com/Pages/OnTheMoney.aspx?pageLabel=AOM316">Intel has noted the speed</a> at which AI programs can “train” themselves doubles every four months, compared to the 24 months that Moore&rsquo;s Law predicted for processor speed.</p>
<p>Towards the end, of course, Sinofsky lapses into Andreessen-style gibberish:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Order is about restricting the “We” to the government and constraining the “We” that is the people. Let that sink in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making “the people” synonymous with &ldquo;extremely rich billionaires and their companies” is, of course, one of the tricks that the rich play again and again and again. AI is being created to enrich the already rich. It requires resources in computing power, which means my only option of accessing it is to rent time on someone else&rsquo;s computer. It reinforces <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/yanis-varoufakiss-technofeudalism-what-killed-capitalism-cb36d44c78f9">technofeudalism</a>. Of course, Silicon Valley, which wants to make sure all of us pays a tithe to them, loves it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time that we have some assertion of democratic control over the forces that shape our lives. The Silicon Valley fat cats don&rsquo;t like it. That, on its own, tells me that regulating AI is probably a good thing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple Notes doesn’t have an export option. Instead, as Obsidian’s blog post on the Importer plugin update explains, it stores your notes in a local SQLite database. The format isn’t documented, but the developers of the plugin were able to reverse-engineer it to allow users to move notes and their attachments out of Notes and into two folders: one with Markdown versions of your notes and the other with the files attached to your notes. The folder with your notes includes subfolders that match any folders you set up in Notes, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is just outstanding work from the Obsidian team. There are a couple of limitations, mostly that it can&rsquo;t import password protected notes (obviously), but I&rsquo;ve tested it and it worked well.</p>
<p>Related: undocumented SQLite databases should not be the way that a multi-gazillion dollar corporation is storing valuable data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) is investigating the range of Tesla’s electric vehicles after reports surfaced that the company was relying on exaggerated numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tesla said that it had “received requests for information, including subpoenas from the DOJ, regarding certain matters associated with personal benefits, related parties, vehicle range and personnel decisions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows on from a Reuters' report earlier this year, which found Tesla was getting so many complaints about range it was cancelling appointments with its service centres for customers with the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, there was nothing actually wrong with the vehicle’s battery. Rather, Tesla had allegedly created software to rig its driving range estimates to show a rosier picture. This led to thousands of customers seeking service appointments to figure out what was wrong with their vehicles. But because the vehicle was working as intended, Tesla’s diversion team simply canceled all the appointments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So Tesla created software which gave a false reading of battery range, then when people spotted it, they just canceled any service to them.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that when VW was caught <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-34324772">cheating on its emissions tests</a> by using a device to check when it was being tested and artificially improving results, it ended up being fined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal#Settlement">tens of billions of dollars</a>.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t on quite that scale, but regulators tend to take a very dim view of cheating customers. It&rsquo;s quite possible this will cost Tesla billions.</p>
<p>Anyone willing to bet that it will turn out this was done at Elon Musk&rsquo;s insistence? And will that be the final nail in the coffin of his reputation?</p>

<p>This is a <strong>very</strong> big deal and should be keeping Tim Cook awake at night. Effectively, it&rsquo;s a small shot across the bows for Foxconn, a reminder that without the good graces of the Chinese government, it can&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Google explained that SGE is part of the Google Search experience; it is a search feature and thus it should work as how normal search directives work. “The context is that AI is built into Search, not bolted on, and integral to how Search functions, which is why robots.txt is the control to give web publishers the option to manage access to how their sites are crawled,” Google told us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using both Bard and Bing CoPilot a lot lately and the direction is clear: while AI-driven search will link to original sources as references, they are not going to send much traffic your way. The aim is to provide the answer to any query on the results page, not one more click away.</p>
<p>This has massive implications for publisher traffic, particular for reviews and answers pages which I think are most vulnerable to AI-driven answers. I&rsquo;ve been using CoPilot for purchasing research and it&rsquo;s great. I can start by asking it for, say, laptops under £1000 with good battery life. I can then have a conversation to interrogate more about each product. It&rsquo;s a superior experience to any web page I have ever used for that kind of product research.</p>
<p>Is it 100% accurate? No &ndash; but neither are a lot of reviews, particularly the kind of &ldquo;best laptop for…&rdquo; top tens that are written to hit the top of product searches on Google.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just affiliate: search provides between 40-80% of publisher site traffic. And we have already seen <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebook-traffic-down-algorithm-change-1850549012#:~:text=Clicks%20coming%20from%20Facebook%20have%20been%20in%20decline,fell%20about%2050%25%20from%20summer%20of%20last%20year.">Facebook traffic, the other biggest referrer, die off</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Publishers can no longer rely on Facebook and Google for the bulk of their traffic.</strong> The time has past when content strategies should focus on them. Instead, they need to focus on getting a loyal audience which they have direct relationships with. The SEO era is coming to an end, at least for large chunks of traffic.</p>

<p>Individuals pay $10 a month for the AI assistant. In the first few months of this year, the company was losing on average more than $20 a month per user, according to a person familiar with the figures, who said some users were costing the company as much as $80 a month.</p>

<p>The first stage of the enshittification cycle is often to charge customers less than it costs to run the service, in order to acquire and lock in as many as possible. After that, at some point, you dump on them from a great height.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of using ChatGPT for writing, because even leaving aside issues of accuracy, its style is stilted and just the wrong side of formulaic. But there&rsquo;s one area where it really works as a writing assistant: giving you an outline on a topic as a starting point.</p>
<p>Tell it what you want and what to include, and it will come back with an outline of everything you should cover. It won&rsquo;t be your final structure, but as a place to start and especially if you&rsquo;re a bit stuck and need something to bounce around to fine-tune your idea, it&rsquo;s a really good assistant.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about large language models as assistants for human creativity lately, in the context of Steve Jobs' old view of computers as &ldquo;a bicycle for the mind&rdquo; and also the Knowledge Navigator video which came later on &ndash; John Sculley&rsquo;s vision of the future of computing. More to come on that&hellip;</p>

			<h1><a href="https://technovia.co.uk/2023/09/15/properties-in-obsidian.html">Properties in Obsidian are a game changer</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I have been an on-again/off-again user of Obsidian for a couple of years and have lately been shifting a lot of my writing work to it, both blogging and fiction. It&rsquo;s an incredibly flexible tool which can be customised to meet your needs.</p>
<p>Version 1.4 introduces <em>Properties</em>, a new interface for metadata. You have always been able to add metadata to notes in two ways: tags, which are just a hashtag in the next followed immediately by the tag; and as YAML, front-matter which is delineated in the note by existing between two sets of three hyphens.</p>
<p>But that YAML has always been visible at the top of your note, which felt kind of clunky. Properties builds on this by taking that YAML and hiding it behind a much nicer interface:</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api/assets/693981/aea72173-5663-459d-83de-6ff888f6bdd5" alt="property-editor"></p>
<p>The nice part is that the data behind this interface is still just YAML delineated by those three dashes at the start of the file, which means it&rsquo;s editable in any text editor. There&rsquo;s no weird database which stores the metadata disconnected from the original file.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Why is this potentially so useful? Because for writing, it will allow me to stop using Tags for things like statuses. At the moment, I add a tag to define the status of a document. For example, I have tags for &ldquo;Blog/Ideas&rdquo;, &ldquo;Blog/InProgress&rdquo; and so on. In the future, instead of having to use tags I will be able to create a Property called &ldquo;Status&rdquo; and have ones for &ldquo;Ideas&rdquo;, &ldquo;In Progress&rdquo; etc predefined. This means that tags can become what they should be &ndash; a form of topic-based loose categorisation &ndash; rather than a mixed bag of topics and statuses and names and so on.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really looking forward to seeing what extension developers do with Properties, in particular what can be built using the Auto Note Mover plugin which basically runs my writing workflow.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This is one of the things I most love about Obsidian&rsquo;s design philosophy: everything possible lives in the note, and the note is just a plain text file in a folder on your local drive. If Obsidian ever died, all my notes and articles would still be right there, usable in any other text editor. I would lose the functionality which Obsidian adds over the top, but not the underlying data.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Microsoft will finally stop forcing Windows 11 users in Europe into Edge if they click a link from the Windows Widgets panel or from search results. The software giant has started testing the changes to Windows 11 in recent test builds of the operating system, but the changes are restricted to countries within the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the European Economic Area (EEA), Windows system components use the default browser to open links,” <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/08/25/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-23531-dev-channel/">reads a change note</a> from a Windows 11 test build released to Dev Channel testers last month. I asked Microsoft to comment on the changes and, in particular, why they’re only being applied to EU countries. Microsoft refused to comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course this isn&rsquo;t happening in the UK: thanks to Brexit, we&rsquo;re not an EEA country, and so you&rsquo;re stuck with Edge opening links from things like widget no matter what browser you choose. Now that&rsquo;s what I call taking back control.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the past 24 hours, the hashtag &ldquo;BanTheADL&rdquo; has been trending on X, the platform formerly known as <a href="https://mashable.com/category/twitter">Twitter</a>. The trending hashtag refers to the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish anti-extremism civil rights organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even more concerning is that X owner <a href="https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-x-twitter-follower-data">Elon Musk</a> has signaled support for the attacks against the ADL on the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the same time frame, numerous X users have also reported being served an X-approved advertisement on the platform that promotes white supremacy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point advertising on Twitter is directly extending financial support to neo-Nazis. It&rsquo;s long past time that companies like Apple,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazon-restart-advertising-twitter-platfomer-reporter-2022-12-04/">resumed advertising on the platform in December 2022, just stopped</a>.</p>
<p>But it won&rsquo;t, which is finally putting the lie to the idea that the company&rsquo;s leadership team care one iota about about the impact its actions make on the culture of the country which nurtured it. &ldquo;You support rampant anti-semitism on your service? No problem! Here&rsquo;s some money. You explicitly allow transphobic hate speech on the service? That&rsquo;s fine with us! Here, have some more money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apple is very good at taking a stand when it&rsquo;s easy. It refused to carry various small right-wing social platforms on its App Store, because the content moderation policies weren&rsquo;t up to scratch. Meanwhile, Twitter gets a pass despite having no practical control over hate speech and an owner who actively encourages it.</p>
<p>Should we be considering boycotting Apple and other companies that advertise on Twitter? Let&rsquo;s frame that another way: if you found out that a company was actively funding hate speech, would you want to buy products from them?</p>
<p>I know I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Why am I picking on Apple here? First because it&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s biggest company.

			 <p><a href="https://om.co/2023/09/01/why-do-companies-become-hostile-to-their-customers/">Om Malik</a> on how the experience in Pocket has declined and his thoughts on Readwise Reader:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To me, Pocket has always been a repository where I save, store, and archive articles I want to read or use for my ongoing research. That’s its value for me. I don’t care much for their “Home Screen” and its recommendations. While it may seem minor, these changes detract from the app’s core purpose, revealing a user-hostile behavior. The changes implemented by Mozilla and Pocket prioritize their interests and haven’t notably improved my user experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Readwise initially offered a service for saving highlights from various sources — Apple Books, Pocket, Amazon Kindle, Twitter, and even Discord. I appreciated their approach. Then they launched Reader, their own “read-it-later” app. It lets me save articles, highlight text, add notes, enable public links, save YouTube videos (with text captions), and offers other features. Both Readwise and its competitor, Matter, prioritize enhancing the online reading experience. Meanwhile, Pocket seems to be deciding for me what I need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I switched from Pocket to Readwise Reader when it was in early beta and I couldn&rsquo;t agree more with Om&rsquo;s assessment. Reader feels like it is built from the ground up to just give me a better experience for getting articles into my inbox, working with them, and getting useful information out of them into other tools. Pocket feels more like it wants to keep me within Pocket.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/08/31/apple-provides-detailed-reasoning-behind-abandoning-iphone-csam-detection?utm_medium=rss">Apple explains why it abandoned iPhone CSAM detection</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Scanning every user&rsquo;s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit,&rdquo; Neuenschwander continued. &ldquo;It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences. Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We decided to not proceed with the proposal for a hybrid client-server approach to CSAM detection for iCloud Photos from a few years ago,&rdquo; he finished. &ldquo;We concluded it was not practically possible to implement without ultimately imperiling the security and privacy of our users.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the things which is interesting about this is that these are the exact arguments which campaigners against Apple&rsquo;s scanning proposal used at the time – and the company seems to have listened.</p>
<p>And that Apple has made its reasoning public gives a strong imperative to it not to try the same thing again, which is a good sign for the future.</p>

<p>“Based on your consent, we may collect and use your biometric information for safety, security, and identification purposes,” the company said in its new policy. X doesn’t define what it considers biometric, though other companies have used the term to describe data gleaned from a person’s face, eyes and fingerprints.</p>

<p>Of the many, many companies on this planet that I would not trust with biometric data, &ldquo;X&rdquo; comes pretty much top of the pile.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-twitter-x-takeover-walter-isaacson-5f553fa">The Real Story of Elon Musk’s Twitter Takeover - WSJ</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The way that Musk blustered into <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-moves-swiftly-to-put-imprint-on-twitter-after-takeover-11666978716?mod=article_inline">buying Twitter</a> and renaming it X was a harbinger of the way he now runs it: impulsively and irreverently. It is an addictive playground for him. It has many of the attributes of a school yard, including taunting and bullying. But in the case of Twitter, the clever kids win followers; they don’t get pushed down the steps and beaten, like Musk was as a kid. Owning it would allow him to become king of the school yard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The whole of this annoyingly paywalled article<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> is full of absolute zingers which demonstrate quite how unsuited Musk is to owning something like Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By then, a new ingredient had been added to this cauldron: Musk’s swelling concern with the dangers of what he called the “woke mind virus” that he believed was infecting America. “Unless the woke mind virus, which is fundamentally anti-science, anti-merit, and anti-human in general, is stopped, civilization will never become multiplanetary,” he told me gravely.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This use of &ldquo;multiplanetary&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a mistake or a metaphor. Musk has bought into the idea that we can wreck this planet and move on to the next, one that&rsquo;s common amongst the Silicon Valley idiocracy.</p>
<p>And always remember, the personal <strong>is</strong> political:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Musk’s anti-woke sentiments were partly triggered by the decision of his oldest child, Xavier, then 16, to transition. “Hey, I’m transgender, and my name is now Jenna,” she texted the wife of Elon’s brother. “Don’t tell my dad.” When Musk found out, he was generally sanguine, but then Jenna became a fervent Marxist and broke off all relations with him. “She went beyond socialism to being a full communist and thinking that anyone rich is evil,” he says… He blamed it partly on the ideology he felt that Jenna imbibed at Crossroads, the progressive school she attended in Los Angeles. Twitter, he felt, had become infected by a similar mindset that suppressed right-wing and anti-establishment voices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s been rumoured for a long time that having a trans child had been an influence on Musk&rsquo;s blatantly transphobic behaviour. This confirms it.</p>
<p>I am very glad that I no longer have a presence on Twitter.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->CNet Deletes Thousands of Old Articles in an Attempt to Game Google Search – Pixel Envy<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Although, as Nick points out, Google advises that simply deleting content does nothing for you there are three circumstances where deleting content very definitely does improve your SEO. But you don’t just delete it. Deleting content without redirecting it or in an unstructured manner just leaves you with a bunch of 404s, which you don’t want. It will also almost certainly break some of the crawl paths which Google and other robots use to find their ways around the site.</p>
<p>But there are circumstances where you want to delete <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and redirect<!-- raw HTML omitted --> content, either because it’s a bunch of content which is actively harming your site’s authority with Google or because it no longer best serves the needs of your audience.</p>
<p>The first is where that content is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->thin<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Thin content is typical old-style news in brief pieces which are very short. Google has always disliked short content (the rule of thumb is under 300 words) and while a few pieces are fine if a sizeable percentage of your content is thin it can hurt you. Those kind of stories tend to date from the early/mid 00’s, when blasting out tonnes of content was the fashion, and a lot of new-in-brief pieces got written.</p>
<p>The second is when you have lots of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->repetitive or duplicate content<!-- raw HTML omitted --> – content which essentially says the same thing, over and over and over again. Big news sites do this a lot, because often with news you have covered the same story with more or less the same facts for a long time. But you will often also have content which is essentially the same, because people have the same idea for an article and don’t bother to check if it already exists – leading to two very similar articles.</p>
<p>Why does that matter? Because Google likes it when there’s one article on your site which provides a clear answer to a specific search query. If you have written two articles on, say, the history of the Mac Plus then it doesn’t know which one to rank and so basically down-ranks both.</p>
<p>The third circumstance is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->where you have old content receiving no traffic but which is about a keyword you are <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->targeting<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Every page has authority on some topics, even if it doesn’t rank well or at all. Often, old content isn’t maintained well. Google likes content which is updated with fresh information, because that content tends to best-serve users arriving from search. If you don’t update content, it tends to gradually lose ranking over time.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best approach with content like this is to start fresh – particularly when you have multiple articles on the same topic. In that case, deleting the old piece and redirecting it to a new URL is the right approach. You get the minimal authority of the old page, sending a clear signal to Google that the new page is the right one for any search queries you previously ranked for.</p>
<p>The <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cnet memo<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on its process is actually a model for how you should do it, with clear guidance and opt-outs for content which is of historical value. Most content isn’t – remember the old adage that today’s news is tomorrow’s fish-and-chip paper – but some stories clearly are. They also ensure that anything deleted is in the Internet Archive (which is another reason why the clear attempts of some publishers to kill it are so stupid).</p>
<p>As a writer, all this can be hard to take – after all you want to see all your articles available – but there are things you can do about it. First, make sure that you keep copies of your work. If you work for a site with an SEO team, talk to them about republishing it on your own personal blog (you can add a canonical to your post to show where the original version was published, and this is actually good for their SEO). And use <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Authory<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to keep an archive of everything across every site you publish on.</p>

		<a href="https://technovia.co.uk/2023/08/01/gnome-windowing-becoming.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-08-01 12:55:06 &#43;0000">Aug 1, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The Gnome foundation, which makes arguably the most popular desktop environment for Linux, is <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2023/07/26/rethinking-window-management/">experimenting with new windowing models</a>. While there&rsquo;s development work going into better tiling, the more interesting mode is what they&rsquo;re calling &ldquo;Mosaic&rdquo; – and to my eyes, it looks quite a bit like Apple&rsquo;s Stage Manager.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how they describe how it works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You open a window, it opens centered on the screen at a size that makes the most sense for the app. For a web browser that might be maximized, for a weather app maybe only 700×500 pixels. As you open more windows, the existing windows move aside to make room for the new ones. If a new window doesn’t fit (e.g. because it wants to be maximized) it moves to its own workspace. If the window layout comes close to filling the screen, the windows are automatically tiled.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s a pretty good description of how Stage Manager works too, although the details are different. By default when you open a new application in Stage Manager, it opens in its own &ldquo;workspace&rdquo;, with other windows sliding into the shelf on the side. Drag another window in and Stage Manager tries to move windows about so they overlap in the smallest possible way. The Gnome approach looks to be more aggressive about tiling and avoiding overlaps, and although the underlying grid which Stage Manager uses is more relaxed in iPadOS 17 it still feels more &ldquo;gridded&rdquo; than Mosaic.</p>
<p>It will be really interesting to see where Gnome goes with this – and what the reaction to it will be. Some parts of the Linux community are heavily committed to tiling and see overlapping windows as basically an error in the history of operating systems, while others are more relaxed and open to new ideas.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I largely agree with <a href="https://pxlnv.com/blog/the-fix-is-in/">Nick Heer&rsquo;s take on Apple&rsquo;s policies on repair</a> – and the criticisms thereof. I don&rsquo;t think Apple goes out of their way to engineer things which are harder to repair, and nor do I believe they deliberately engineer-in stuff which breaks third party repairs. They just build stuff to incredibly tight tolerances and are very specific about parts. <strong>But&hellip;</strong> that is ultimately an engineering choice, too. Apple chooses to place tight integration over giving users more ability to repair and replace parts.</p>
<p>To give Apple credit, this tight integration is part of what gives Apple devices longevity. Predictable parts means that Apple can optimise future operating systems to known targets, which is helpful if you want to ensure an older phone is usable with newer software. But I think still think it&rsquo;s the wrong call. While it gives technical advantage, it increases e-waste and ultimately lessens the lifespan of the device.</p>
<p>Apple doesn&rsquo;t have to create modular phones that are incredibly easy to repair, although it would be fantastic if it applied its undoubted engineering prowess to doing so. There are a lot of things it <em>could</em> do which aren&rsquo;t as radical as that. Apple <em>could</em> publish its calibration processes, which would make third party repair easier. It <em>could</em> publish the schematics for its devices, as for example Fairphone do (but other phone makers don&rsquo;t). It <em>chooses</em> not to do these things. Everything about Apple&rsquo;s behaviour here is a choice, one that it could and should change.</p>
<p>(And before someone jumps in with &ldquo;fiduciary duty to maximise profits blah blah&rdquo; &ndash; even in the US, where shareholder primacy is fairly well established, courts have long held that shareholder value is not the same as simple profits.)</p>
<p>Five billion mobile phones will be thrown away this year, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63245150">and the majority of them will not be recycled</a>. Apple is in a position to do something which benefits its customers and society – and it is choosing not to. It could lead the industry. Instead, it&rsquo;s contributing to making the planet a less healthy, more polluted place. History will not be kind on the likes of Apple.</p>
<p>(PS This is a bit of an experiment in publishing something to my Micro.blog rather than Wordpress, so bare with me if it goes a bit wrong.)</p>

			 <p>This week, I mostly gave myself a week off which meant I hit level 60 on my character in the new Diablo 4 season. That’s understandable, but I need to make sure that I don’t spend <em>too</em> much time just lazing around even if there is a World Cup to watch.</p>
<p>If you don’t know about it, the wonderful publisher <a href="https://www.andotherstories.org/subscriptions/">And Other Stories have a brilliant subscription scheme</a>. For £70 a year, you get six books – but you also get your name in the back of the book, and get them a couple of months in advance of publication. That means you have to wait a while for your subscription to kick in, and my first book arrive this week. It’s “<a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781913505721">Traces of Enayat</a>”, by Iman Mersal, and I’m looking forward to it.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-things-which-most-caught-my-attention">The three things which most caught my attention</h2>
<ol>
<li>Cory not only skewers Tesla (and Musk) in this piece on <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/">Autoshittification</a>, he also draws lines showing how we are being drawn into a form of feudalism.</li>
<li>I am <a href="https://transwrites.world/uk-labour-is-outright-lying-public-support/">so fucking tired of the Labour Party&rsquo;s duplicitous bullshit on trans rights</a>. Not as tired as my trans friends must be, but still. I won&rsquo;t be voting Labour next time because the party is happy to keep my local MP in place, despite <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/02/02/rosie-duffield-labour-mp-trans-views/">spouting hatred at every opportunity she gets</a>.</li>
<li>I don’t entirely agree with the conclusions that Erin Kissane comes to in <a href="https://erinkissane.com/mastodon-is-easy-and-fun-except-when-it-isnt">her article about why Mastodon didn’t stick for a few people</a>, but it’s well worth a read. I think a lot of confusion is down to the expectation that a federated system works (and <strong>should</strong> work) like a centralised one – which is why some people find Bluesky more comforting. A Bluesky which lives up to its intentions would be federated and in many ways as confusing to new users as Mastodon – but at the moment, it’s not actually a federated system. It’s no different to t2, or any one of the plethora of other similar centralised services, other than it was founded by Jack Dorsey.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="things-i-have-been-writing">Things I have been writing</h2>
<p>I rediscovered a story which I started writing at some point about a doctor who isn’t quite what he appears, and pushed it a bit further. It took me a while to actually realise that <em>I</em> had written it – there are some interesting stylistic tricks in it which I had forgotten playing around with. Along with the story that I developed at Arvon I’m going to finish that in the coming week.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-have-been-reading">Things I have been reading</h2>
<p>China Mieville’s “<a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781803289342">A Spectre, Haunting</a>” crossed my radar and, as it’s a short one, I started reading it. It’s excellent of course, although China is very much in his academic mode rather than entertaining.</p>

			 <p>I’ve been feeling somewhat melancholy this week. I suspect the cause of that is mostly physical: I have also been feeling quite run down, not to the point of exhaustion but definitely lacking in energy. The two things usually go hand in hand: Kim has occasionally described how my emotions emerge from me like a cloud, surrounding me, and it works both ways. When my body is struggling, my emotions cluster around me, and when I’m feeling strong emotions, I wear it across my body like a gaudy sash.</p>
<p>We spent part of the last long weekend before August dog sitting two Bedlington terriers who manage to combine whip-smarts with the utter irrationality of all dog kind when it comes to the three things most important to them: snacks, shitting and chasing rabbits. I miss having a dog although I would probably want one that wasn’t <strong>quite</strong> so excitable. An elderly dog who likes a little amble and wistful glance towards the rabbits in the field is probably about my speed.</p>
<p>On Wednesday we went up to that there London to see <a href="https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/literature-poetry/jeremy-deller-art-magic" title="Art is magic">Jeremy Deller in conversation with Emma Warren</a> talking about <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781800811645">Art is Magic</a></em>. I love his work – honestly if you don’t like <em>We’re here because we’re here</em> you have no heart – but I also love that he’s not a trained artist, didn’t go to art school, and is what the art establishment likes to call and “outsider artist”. That’s a phrase which, of course, reeks of the privilege they have and how they like to project it. We are insiders – you are an outsider. And we all know that outsiders aren’t to be trusted.</p>
<p>It’s possibly one of the reasons why it’s taken me fifty years to admit to myself that some of what I do might actually be art, rather than <em>craft</em> or <em>a trade</em>. We shall see. It still feels more than a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Kim has been off in France – first Paris, then Montpellier – doing fun art things since Thursday. That meant she didn’t have to suffer the FA Cup Final with me (our friend Edward came round for shit talking and snack eating) and I’m taking the opportunity to do a bunch of chores that have been on my list of things to do for far too long. Related: my back now hurts. One more thing to talk to the doctor about at some point.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-have-been-writing">Things I have been writing</h2>
<p><a href="https://ianbetteridge.com/2023/06/03/the-time-of-seclusion-and-loss/" title="The time of isolation and loss">I wrote something on my experience of covid</a>. This isn’t the first thing I have written about the pandemic, but I think it’s the most complete account of how it’s made me feel, and think, and act differently.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-have-been-reading">Things I have been reading</h2>
<p>I finished off M John Harrison’s “anti-memoir” <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781800812970">Wish I was here</a></em> in just a couple of days. It’s very Harrison: don’t expect a linear narrative about the events in his life, or a how-to manual on writing weird fiction. It’s as much a piece of art writing as the rest of his recent work, and has the opacity and determination not to explain things which he’s really been playing around with for a long time.</p>
<p>Of course I loved it, but I’ve always loved his work, ever since as a nine or 10 year old I picked up a copy of <em>The Centauri Device</em> while on holiday in Spain. I was obsessed with science fiction and this was the only book I would find amongst the tiny selection of English-language paperbacks in the Spanish newsagent which catered to Brits on their cheap package holiday. Harold Robbins, James Clavell, Dennis Wheatley and M John Harrison. I have sometimes wondered quite how they ended up stocking it, but whoever decided that a Spanish newsagent was the right place for a story of spacefaring anarchists deserves my thanks.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what to read next. This is always an interesting moment: a few days of paralysis while I work out what my brain wants to absorb. I’m tempted to jump into <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9780141986388">Goodbye, Things</a></em> by Fumio Sasaki as a bit of a break from fiction. It’s been in the book pile for a couple of weeks, which is usually the optimum time for reading: any longer, and it tends to get buried by other options. Any shorter, and it interrupts what I’m already reading. And I hate to stop reading a book before the end: abandoning something always feels like a moral failure, even though intellectually I know it’s the right thing to do.</p>

			 <p>I think it’s only now, with the benefit of two years of processing, that I’m really able to think and write about covid and the lockdowns of March 2020 onwards. And it’s only now that I have started to feel like life has really resumed, that I’m able to just go out and do things: see art, go to talks, listen to live music. In the last few months, something has resumed. It’s not my old life, but it is something.</p>
<p>There was that amazingly strange moment in time when everyone was effectively housebound, confined in a way which no British population in history had been before. You couldn’t drive anywhere unless it was to get to essential work, or to shop – and if you did shop, only one person from a household was allowed to go unless there were extenuating circumstances. You could leave the house to exercise, for as long as you wanted, but only meeting the people within your household. Friends and strangers alike had to be kept at a distance. If someone was coming your way, you crossed the road to avoid them.</p>
<p>Before lockdown there was a period when everyone knew it was coming but everyone wanted to believe that washing your hands for 20 seconds was the solution. It hit us early. On the 13th March – naturally a Friday – one of our friends came from London for a visit. By Sunday, he was sick enough for us to have to drive him home, with rumours swirling that London would enter a lockdown which might see no one able to come in or out of it.</p>
<p>By Wednesday 18th March I was sick too. A minor cough, but what made me know it was covid was the exhaustion. It took me 30 minutes to write a five line email to my manager at work, telling her I thought I had covid, because I barely had the strength to type. Then Kim was sick. There were no tests available: the few PCR tests were going to hospitals. If you got sick, you just had to wait and hope it didn’t get bad enough for you to need an ambulance, breathing apparatus, intubation, critical care.</p>
<p>And the following Monday, 23rd March 2020, everyone was ordered to stay in their homes.</p>
<p>In lockdown, one weekend we walked from our home up on Tyler Hill in Canterbury down to one of the city centre parks because we had heard a rumour that there was a stall still selling takeaway coffee due to some kind of loophole in the regulations. A two mile walk to get a cappuccino. I almost cried – it was the first time in weeks that I had felt that somehow, perhaps, things might get better.</p>
<p>Lockdown has affected everything. I look at the fashions of the young people at university – kids who spent nearly two crucial years barely able to socialise with their friends except online – and they wear the kind of clothes that everyone adopts when they don’t have to leave the house: baggy sportswear, shapeless and comfortable, with none of the effort or styling which usually moulds your appearance at that age. It’s a bland conformity driven not by the surrounding culture but by a lack of surrounding culture. Humans are social animals: when that sociability turns into something which might kill them, they suffer.</p>
<p>And everyone I know has suffered in one way or another. Social bonds, prematurely loosened to the point of breakage. Friendships that took a hiatus during lockdown and have never returned. Mental health which means you struggle around strangers, or desperately seek the company of someone, anyone, while finding company strangely unrewarding.</p>
<p>No one feels like they did. And I don’t know anyone who feels they used the experience of lockdown and changed for the better. I know plenty of people for whom that was an intention: lockdown as a time to stop, a time to reinvent themselves, a time to study and take the time to read. But I don’t know anyone who came out of it more healthy or wise than they went into it.</p>
<p>I worry about kids. I know it’s possible to recover from badly disrupted schooling and from mental health issues in childhood (I went through it) but this is different. This was a mass trauma and I think we are, as always underestimating quite what an effect it will have both on individuals and our whole society. Children are more resilient than the mythologisers of childhood innocence would believe, but they are also more vulnerable than the stiff-upper-lip brigade fantasise about.</p>
<p>Covid isn’t over. While the rhetoric of “learning to live with covid” has been used as an ideological figleaf for a government policy of ignoring it and pretending it didn’t happen the truth is that we **do ** have to learn to live with it. It’s not going away and the wise course of action would be to put as many mitigations in place to prevent future outbreaks as possible. Better ventilation in buildings, encouraging wearing masks (as the Japanese always have) when you feel even slightly under the weather, and of course a consistent public campaign of booster vaccination could all play a part in ensuring that we never have to go through a lockdown again.</p>
<p>Our current government, which made a policy platform out of ignoring the consequences of Brexit are of course uniquely unsuited to doing any of this. They are born chancers, riding gamblers’ luck with our futures and our lives. They would rather believe something will come along to make covid go away entirely – or that they can do nothing and it will be someone else’s problem if and when it returns in strength.</p>
<p>I said earlier that only now has my old life resumed, but that does not mean I am unchanged. I’m in worse physical shape than I was pre-lockdown (and I wasn’t in great shape then). Perhaps connected to having had two bouts of covid, I came out of it with significantly higher blood pressure than I went in, and weighing a fair chunk more. Lack of mobility when I work from home means that, unless I deliberately exercise, my average steps per day hovers down at the 4,000 level rather than over 10,000, which was where it was “in the before times”.</p>
<p>My mental health suffered too, in ways which it’s hard to put my finger on. I am more anxious (and I was no stranger to anxiety). But I have also become more aware of my own needs in terms of people. Far from being the one who didn’t need a lot of people around him to, it turns out that I do, that I love being around people and function best when I am. Who would have predicted that I am, in fact, a thoroughly social animal – a perfect exemplar of how most of my fellow humans are?</p>
<p>It also radicalised me. Covid, and the government’s response to it, exposed the middle ground of politics for what it always was: a comforting lie, something that I wanted to believe was true because I always like to believe everyone has people’s best interests at heart. During lockdown, the capitalists and their cronies came out of the woodwork in droves to dip their snouts in the trough of government money, with chancers (or “entrepreneurs”, in Toryspeak) appearing to sell us billions of pounds of useless PPE, growing fat on margins. Profiteering shits of the kind which appear in any disaster, but which our “third way” centralist politics pretended had gone away.</p>
<p>Health workers who were clapped in the streets, then denied a decent wage once it was “all over”. Bus and train staff who were lauded as “key workers” in the pandemic and made to risk their lives so that people could continue to do vital work, only to be told they were greedy when they dared to ask for their salaries to rise in line with inflation.</p>
<p>The old histories always made out that great men make the times. But that’s nonsense. The times make us, and they also show us a little bit of what we really are. We have to live through whatever life throws at us, and the events around us shape us to a far greater degree than we like to admit. Covid, those two years of seclusion and loss, are going to be with us for a very long time. The only thing we can do to make it all more tolerable is to tell our stories, and hope for change.</p>

			 <p>Bank holiday! Another one! Yay!</p>
<p>On Friday we went over to Margate to see <em>The Chimera Function</em>, a performance lecture by artist and researched Lo Lo No which involved quite a bit of cutup spoken word stuff. I had never been to the Tom Thumb Theatre before and loved it – the work was pretty interesting, and if you’re interested in experimental spoken-word stuff I would recommend seeing it if you get the chance.</p>
<p>Saturday night I was doing my own spoken word piece at the Free Range open mic night. My work isn’t experimental: I just like telling stories. And as part of it I told my own story, or rather the story of how I didn’t write any stories for over 40 years and finally started when I decided that was really silly.</p>
<p>After that we went along to our friend Edward’s birthday drink, then headed home via a really rather large Five Guys burger (grilled cheese for me, of course). Memo to self: you really don’t need to have even the medium fries. Small is more than enough.</p>
<p>Today was my fortnightly writing group, but I ended up only being able to stay for an hour because I planned to meet up with Kim and head over to Herne Bay to collect her mobile phone (she had left it on the bus on Saturday night, and I needed to be with her to find the bus station where it had been left after being found).</p>
<p>I also took delivery of a new monitor. A couple of months ago I moved the Mac mini and my old monitor out of my study to give myself more desk space, so have been using my laptop on its own. It hasn’t quite worked: although it was nice to have such an open and uncluttered desk, leaning over a laptop doesn’t suit my body, and propping it up on a stand just means I end up peering into the 13in screen from a distance which isn’t great for my eyes.</p>
<p>The new monitor is a Dell S2722QC USB-C 27in 4K thing, which is similar to the ones we use in the office. It’s good – not only does having USB-C mean that I can connect and charge my laptop on it. But Dell’s stands allow me to move the monitor up and down which my old LG couldn’t. So no more having a monitor on top of a stand which isn’t quite the right height.</p>
<p>I didn’t realise how much the details of the environment that I work in made a difference to how I feel about working. Things like having a decent keyboard, a screen that’s the right size and height, and all the other things make a big difference not only on things like my posture and my back but also in how producing and creative I feel. It sounds stupid, but it’s true.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-have-been-writing">Things I have been writing</h2>
<p>At today’s writing group I only had about half an hour so dived in and wrote a short piece of micro-fiction which I’m quite happy with – so I will be publishing that on <a href="https://write.as/ianbetteridge">the writing blog</a> at some point soon.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-have-been-reading">Things I have been reading</h2>
<p>I have been continuing on with <em>Temereire</em>, which is a fun and easy read. This week also saw the arrival of M John Harrison’s <em>Wish I was here</em> too, which is a sort-of biography from my absolute favourite author. I’m looking forward to diving into that.</p>

			 <p>There’s been a lot of London this week. I’m doing a stint of training sessions for various teams across the business – eight sessions this week, basically two a day – and I prefer to do them from the office so I was in for four days running. The good bit is that I get a later train in (the sessions start at 11, so I can get the 9.21) the bad bit is that it turns out commuting is quite tiring. Who knew???</p>
<p>It does have some plus points. It’s nice to see people face to face, and to have those kind of serendipitous chats to your colleagues which actually drive some of the more valuable creative work. It’s good to have a proper gap between work and home. The hour on the train serves that function really well. And it’s nice to have to avoid the inevitable temptation of ill-disciplined home work, where I slide out of bed at 8.45 and am furiously typing Teams messages fifteen minutes later.</p>
<p>I like working at home. But I like working at home <em>on my stuff</em>, rather than the business. That, I like to keep at arms length – and the blurring of home and work life which I fought hard to resist during the pandemic is finally catching up with me. I need more discipline about that, because I have lots of other things which I want to do.</p>
<p>I was <a href="https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0020/">reading Mo Morgan’s weeknote</a> yesterday and he mentioned switching email providers. I’m not sure if Mo is actually my doppelgänger, but I have been doing <strong>exactly</strong> the same dance this week, working on trying out Fastmail. I’m impressed with it, and I am already certain that at the end of the trial period I’ll move all my email and calendars to it.</p>
<p>Another service that I’ve been looking at this week is Authory, which I have been using and recommending for a few years. I did an interview with them about how it meets my needs and was gushingly positive. If you don’t know it, and you’re a writer on the web, you should be using it: it basically scans sites that you write for for your work and create a personal archive of it. So, when someone on the site’s audience development team decides that your old content should be redirect fodder for strengthening another article’s rankings, you don’t lose your work.</p>
<p>(Yes, I have done that to people’s work. I’m sorry.)</p>
<p>Authory has some really nice features. You can use it to create a portfolio site which has all your content from across the web on it. Or you can have an email susbcription using it, so people get all your stuff if they sign up. Oh, and if you tell it a site where your content is, it will go through and find all the existing content to preserve, which is useful when, like me, you have done a bunch of freelance work over the years.</p>
<p>I am still getting slightly scratchy about how to set up my desk at home. A few weeks ago I exiled the Mac mini into the spare room, because although it was great it also tended to dominate the desk. I had a computer and pretty big monitor right in front of me, and it just didn’t feel right.</p>
<p>So I moved the Mac mini and now use my MacBook Air M2. It’s on a stand at the moment, which raise it to a nice height, and I use the Keychron K2 with it which has a lovely action on it. But somehow it still seems like… a lot? Just having the laptop on the desk might be a better option, even though ergonomically I know for a fact that’s terrible. Or maybe I should just go back to having a monitor and a minimal Mac mini setup. Decisions, decisions.</p>
<p>Yesterday we went down to Chichester and saw “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/15/kaye-donachie-song-for-the-last-act-review-pallant-house-gallery-chichester-gwen-john">Kaye Donachie: Song for the Last Act</a>” at the Pallant House Gallery. It was really good and I would highly recommend it, and the whole gallery too. Pallant House specialises in modern art and does some really interesting curatorial stuff, contextualising the work in different ways. There’s also some great work by Gwen John, which you need to see.</p>
<h2 id="things-ive-been-reading">Things I’ve been reading</h2>
<p>For a bit of a change of pace I’ve been reading <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9780007258710">Temeraire</a></em>, which is basically Napoleonic Wars with dragons. It’s really fun and of course I’m breezing through it.</p>

			 <p>This week was mostly about training at work. Not me doing training: me training other people, and developing supporting materials, and so on. It’s been a while since I did proper training, and it was a lot of work.</p>
<p>It was also interesting how different groups react differently: I did three sessions and two went really well, while the other felt like an absolute disaster. The people I was training in the hard session weren’t getting what they wanted from the tools I’m training out, and it really showed.</p>
<p>Wednesday evening I was lucky enough to spend some time in the company of a really lovely set of people at a dinner organised for <em>Interesting</em> by the redoubtable Russell Davies. It reminded me how much I like the company of people that I don’t know, as long as I let go and allow myself to enjoy it. Interesting 2023 is next week and there are still tickets available: I would strongly recommend you go.</p>
<p>On Friday, I woke up with a nasty sore throat, which meant that I could work, but couldn’t talk. It wasn’t much fun and – as I had the same issue last week when I was unwell – I wonder if it was something connected to that. When I poked around at the very swollen tonsil on the left-hand side, I got a really unpleasant squirt of <strong>something</strong> out, which probably means it was some kind of infection. It feels OK now, but it’s something to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>It’s not the only thing that’s wrong with me at the moment. I also have an odd trapped nerve in my back, which makes it hard to stand still for long periods of time. Walking is fine, but standing gives me a sore, uncomfortable feeling in my lower back on the left. I think it’s a trapped nerve because of the weird other symptom: when it’s really sore, the front of my left thigh goes a little numb. Getting old is fun!</p>
<p>It makes me realise quite how much the body is a set of interconnected parts which affect each other. Because I have that pain on the left of my back, when I stand for a long period I tend to put more weight on the right leg and that means I end up with a sore ankle. This is how bodies collapse: not in a single bad thing, but in a small series of problems which cause and amplify each other.</p>
<p>All fixable of course, and more important, preventable too. I’ll get there.</p>
<h2 id="things-ive-written-this-week">Things I’ve written this week</h2>
<p>I wrote a piece of micro-fiction called <em>The memory of everything you ever felt</em>, about a quite unfamiliar kind of hell. It’s only a couple of hundred words, and I’ll post it once I have a chance to edit it.</p>
<p>I also started a longer short piece about a man who misses his plane and meets someone who is stuck in-between countries, and so has lived in the airport for some unspecified amount of time. If this sounds a bit like <em>The Terminal</em>… well, it’s not. All is not as it seems. It’s another small exploration of The Weird, and I want to finish it off this week.</p>
<h2 id="things-ive-read-this-week">Things I’ve read this week</h2>
<p>I finished Julia Armfield’s <em>Our wives under the sea</em>, which was outstanding. I really love her writing style, and I wish I could write this kind of amazing clarity of voice.</p>
<p>Of course, that means I’m on to the next book — or rather, books. When I finish one thing, I rarely have a great idea of what I’m going to read next, and so I tend to dive into a few books and see what sticks. This week it’s been a few pages of <em>Rooms of their own</em> by Nino Strachey, some of <em>All gates are open</em> by Irmin Schmidt and a bit of Laine Looney’s look at the world of early microcomputers, <em>The Apple II Age</em>. None of them have quite stuck yet, so I may jump into something else instead. There’s a lot on the list.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I hate being ill, so I have hated this week. After having a tickly throat on Tuesday, Wednesday morning I woke up with a full-blown very sore throat which I couldn’t talk around, plus a head that felt like it was stuffed with old socks found at the bottom of a particularly disreputable drawer. Oh and, of course, the kind of tiredness that makes you feel completely out of control of your body.</p>
<p>That wrote off Wednesday and Thursday, which, because of the first flush of warm early summer weather, were unpleasantly spent in bed sweating and feeling dreadful. I was finally able to get up on Friday and feel human enough to head down to the sea for an evening “fuck the Tories” ice cream. Wasn’t it wonderful to see them defeated so comprehensively that they immediately had to crown a new king to get everyone distracted?</p>
<p>On Saturday, I was feeling well enough to demand a drive to a country house and some fresh air, which is how we ended up at Knole in Sevenoaks. It’s part of the character of Sevenoaks – and tells you a lot about it as a place – that there is a large country house and deer park right next to it. Or rather, <em>in</em> it: where most maps look like cities eat away at the surrounding countryside, Sevenoaks seems like Knole has devoured part of it, the green biting a chunk from the concrete grey.</p>
<p>Knole is an incredibly well-preserved 17th century house and was the home of the Sackville family, who later became the Sackville-West family. Vita Sackville-West was born here, and her inability to inherit the house – denied by British primogeniture laws – was something she was bitter about her entire life. Instead, the house (and title) went to her uncle Charles, who bequeathed it to the National Trust in 1947.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-have-been-reading">Things I have been reading</h2>
<p>I skipped a few days reading this week – there is nothing I like less than reading when I’m confined to bed ill – but I have been pressing on with Julia Armfield’s <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781529017250">Our wives under the sea</a></em>, which I am enjoying a lot. I would love my own writing to be this accomplished. Many passages have been clipped from it, and there are times when she hits the mark with a sentence so well that it almost leaves me breathless. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see my mother in myself, though less in the sense of inherited features and more in the sense of an intruder poorly hidden behind a curtain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Panic is a misuse of oxygen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Knole I bought <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781841657882">Rooms of their own</a></em> by Nino Strachey, which is a large format pictorial book of the rooms of Edward Sackville-West, Vita Sackville-West, and (of course) Virginia Woolf. If you don’t find the Bloomsbury group and their era fascinating, you’re missing out.</p>
<p>Related, I also bought <em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781472132482">The Crichel Boys</a></em> by Simon Fenwick, which focuses in part on Eddy’s later life when he bought a house down in Dorset with some friends. That will be next on the list – I feel like I’ve read a lot of fiction lately and need to balance it out. Reading books about writers seems like a good half-way house.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I am total agreement with <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2023/04/blue-skies-over-mastodon/">Jamie Zawinski</a> here. There is no way I will trust anything that Jack Dorsey has anything to do with. He’s either incredibly naive – in which case he should be nowhere near a service which requires trust and safety to be at the front of everyone’s minds – or he knew what Musk was like and didn’t care (in which case… you guessed it).</p>
<p>I don’t, though, really care if people jump from Twitter to BlueSky. There is room for more than one successful microblogging platform and different people will have priorities which aren’t the same as mine. I don’t particularly want to spent a massive amount of effort on a centralised service, but you might feel differently.</p>
<p>There is a lot of Highlander syndrome here: “there can be only one” social network which wins, there can be only one platform which everyone must be on. Some of this comes from the narratives which tech journalists love to write about. Conflict sells, conflict drives clicks, and if you can personalise the conflict to two “heroic founder” figures duking it out, all the better.</p>
<p>This isn’t, by the way, some kind of failing solely in journalism. Our oldest and most fundamental narratives frame things as battles between giants. The myths of gods and heroes are full of them, and seeing founders in the same vein is just part of the same old story. We do it with kings, religious leaders, scientists, you name it. Even our efforts to celebrate the collective often devolve back into hero worship. We’re just not very good at celebrating the collective, unless we have a clear enemy to stand against.</p>

			 <p>I was an early user of ChromeOS. Not as early as David Ruddock, who has written <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a post on how Google’s flagship desktop operating system has stalled<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but as soon as the first commercially available Chromebook was out. I was in. Since then I’ve always had a Chromebook in my life, and usually it’s been a pretty high-end one. Sometimes, as was the case with the Pixelbook, they have spent quite a chunk of time as my main or even only laptop.</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure that I made a similar argument to David’s a few years ago. When rumours that ChromeOS and Android were going to merge, or that Android apps would come to ChromeOS, I was not only sceptical, but actually antagonistic towards the idea. Android apps would mean less focus on web apps, and that means less focus on what ChromeOS is really, really good at: the web.</p>
<p>I think, though, that David’s piece doesn’t really focus on what Google was trying to achieve with ChromeOS and so he misses the mark. To understand that, you need to look at what people actually use computers for now.</p>
<p>First of all, it’s important to split how people use laptops between work and home. David says:</p>
<p>“I say this even as one of the few people who can do 95% of my job on a Chromebook: that 5%, when you really, really need it, is more than enough reason to avoid a platform entirely. And for many others, it&rsquo;s much more than 5%: it&rsquo;s their entire workflow.”</p>
<p>Actually, probably 90% of workers who use a laptop can do their jobs on a Chromebook. If your life revolves around office applications – and that’s most people who use a computer for work – then web apps are not only fine, in many cases they are the only option on a laptop. The Microsoft Office suite is a first-class citizen on the web, and some of Microsoft’s PWA’s are excellent. I’ve known Office 365 deployments where people don’t even bother to have the desktop apps installed. Salesforce… does it even have a Windows or Mac desktop version? It’s all about the web.</p>
<p>In that environment, ChromeOS is fine – and it has been for years.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of people, typically in the creative industries, who require applications that either don’t exist on the web or where the web apps just aren’t good enough. Because journalists work in this area they often think everyone does.</p>
<p>But as Benedict Evans has repeatedly pointed out, there are seven million Adobe Creative Cloud subscribers out of the 1.5bn PCs in the world. That’s less than 0.5% of all computer users. Adobe isn’t the be-all and end-all of creative software or of software you can’t do with web apps, but even being generous it’s hard to make the case that the total number of PC users who can’t live in a world of web apps gets to more than between 2-5% of users.</p>
<p>Home users are a little different. Yes, there are home users who fall into that nebulous category of “prosumer” – the kind of people who do “proper” photography or video editing, and want/need Photoshop or Premiere/Final Cut to do that. But again, they’re rare. The majority of the world’s photographs and videos are created, edited, published and viewed on smartphones, never touching a PC at all.</p>
<p>The one thing that lots of home users do with laptops which Chromebooks struggle with is games, and even here the majority of casual gaming is phone based. This is where having Android app support for ChromeOS makes sense: being able to play the huge range of casual and less casual mobile games on a ChromeOS laptop would be awesome. Sadly though – and this is where David’s piece is correct – to do it properly you need the developers to have optimised for larger screens, and to put it bluntly most simply haven’t bothered.</p>
<p>Remember I said that for web apps, “ChromeOS is fine – and has been for years”. That’s actually Google’s biggest challenge. In the space of nine years, ChromeOS has run slap into the same challenge that it took Windows and MacOS three decades to get to: there really aren’t a lot of improvements to make. Of course, ChromeOS needs to keep pace with web APIs and – in true Google style – push them forward. And there are definitely areas for improvement, like biometric support (as David highlights). You can improve the interface, as all OS’ should.</p>
<p>But what else do you want ChromeOS to do, other than be the best platform for running the web apps which 90% of users care about?</p>

			 <p>Never let a bunch of people decide anything that you have to do via a Twitter poll. In my case, very definitely don’t let them condemn you to a week-long trial of any product other than the ones you favour.
That’s how I ended up spending a week or so using the Google Pixel 3 XL rather than my beloved iPhone XS Max. My Apple Watch sat on the sidelines and in its place on my wrist came a Fossil Sport watch running Wear OS.
I gave it a shot. But how did it actually do? And did I end up tearing my hair out?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Top of the list: Google Assistant. Although there are a couple of ways that Assistant is worse than Siri, by and large it’s a huge step upwards. Even though it still hasn’t got totally to grips with my accent (no, Google, “hole” does not mean the same thing as “hall”. I do not have any lights in my hole) Assistant’s ability to answer queries and generally get things done is outstanding.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First, there was FaceID. Once you’ve got used to just glancing at your phone and opening it up instantly, going back to having to press your finger on a fingerprint reader makes you feel like you have gone back to some kind of technological dark age.</p>
<p>Next there’s Siri. Now I know that I said Google Assistant was way ahead — and it is — but there’s one area that Siri still stands head and shoulders above its Google rival, and that’s home automation. Even after all this time, Google Assistant does not understand that homes have different regions where you might want to turn off and on a bunch of lights: or, as we sometimes call them, “upstairs and downstairs”.</p>
<p>Apps, too, are still behind. There are plenty of streak trackers, but none as good as Streaks. There are plenty of task lists, but none as good as either OmniFocus or Things. Google Fit is fine, but as a hub for all your health information, it’s laughable compared to Apple Health and as a fitness app it’s not as good as Fitness.</p>
<p>Then there’s the hardware and software eco-system and how everything just works together. You would think this might be an area where Google could lead, but instead it lags. Android and Chrome OS still feel like strangers sitting next to each other on a train, rather than a couple.</p>
<p>Then there’s Apple Watch: boy, did I miss Apple Watch. Although I used a pretty decent recent wear OS device (the Fossil Sport), it’s pretty laughable as a wearable. Design-wise, the hardware is fine: this, after all, is a company that knows how to make good looking objects for your wrist. But the software and speed of the device itself are probably compatible to a first generation Apple Watch. Google Assistant, which should be a star on the wrist, is a laggy joke. And the lack of decent applications makes it pretty useless on the whole.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And it is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> good camera, capable of producing consistently excellent images across a huge range of lighting conditions. You just won’t get many duff shots out of the Pixel 3.</p>
<p>However, what you are not getting is anything close to images that are true to life, and every now and then the computational photography approach just completely messes up. Portrait mode, for example, will do wacky things like blur out the frame of someone’s glasses rather than correctly interpreting them as part of the face. Occasionally, the Pixel’s desire to make colours pop out at every opportunity also betrays it. For example, taking a wide picture of a kitchen while a friend was cooking, the Pixel decided that because they were wearing a yellow sweater, it should also add a pale yellow tinge to their face. Perhaps that algorithm needs to learn that “jaundiced” isn’t a natural human skin tone.</p>
<p>Portrait mode is also an interesting area. When the iPhone XS Max first came out, Apple’s algorithms for portrait mode over-smoothed skin to a crazy degree. Apple has tweaked these since, and now it’s the Pixel 3’s face smoothing looks over done. It’s not bad: but as soon as you look closely at an image, it’s pretty obvious what the Pixel is trying to do.</p>
<p>Then there’s Night Sight. This is widely – and rightly – regarded as something of a miracle. Even outside, on a pretty dark night with little illumination to work with I can get a clear shot of what’s going on in the garden. But it’s also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weird<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looking, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeff Brouws<!-- raw HTML omitted --> work, and looks absolutely nothing like what you’re seeing in front of you.</p>
<p>There’s no optical zoom on the Pixel 3. And amazingly, you will very rarely care, because Google has done an absolutely amazing job of creating a digital zoom that’s almost as good as having a second lens. Almost – but not quite. This is an area where optics will always beat computation, but unless you’re constantly using zoom, the digital zoom on the Pixel will make you very happy indeed. Good job, Google.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you are not going to go wrong with either of these cameras. Is the camera better than the iPhone XS Max? It depends on what kinds of images you prefer. Do you want something that looks more or less like what you’re seeing in front of you? The iPhone is your better option. Do you want something that’s “better” in the sense of brighter, more energetic and with lighting that looks bright but not over-lit? The Pixel is probably the camera for you. The colours you end up with on screen will look great – but they will be nothing like the colours that your eye will have seen at the time.</p>

<p>Android Q’s third developer beta just came out, and for a bit of fun I decided to install it – and I very much like what I’ve seen so far. The gesture interface (which is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->so<!-- raw HTML omitted --> copied from iOS) is more consistent and coherent than the current version, and I like the dark mode even if – as yet – not many applications support it.</p>
<p>Now you’ll have to excuse me, as I have some SIM swapping to do…</p>

			 <p>I’ve always been someone who has background noise around them. Growing up, the TV was always on, and my dad spent his time singing around the house – he couldn’t hear a silence without filling it with a song. My mum said that she knew my dad was seriously ill when he stopped singing.</p>
<p>I’ve been the same. Get home, turn the TV on, or – more recently – turn the radio on. When I lived in houses where the TV wasn’t the centre of the world, or I didn’t have one (strange to think I’ve lived in places with no TV!) then I would sing, or listen to music. I swam in noise.</p>
<p>Silence was a stranger.</p>
<p>And deeper than that, silence made me feel lonely. I used to listen to the radio late at night, while going to sleep, because the soft background hubbub of quiet voices made me feel like I wasn’t alone in the world. Noise, and especially talking, showed me the world was still alive, that things were still as they should be.</p>
<p>Since starting to meditate regularly I’ve become much more comfortable with silence. I still lapse into singing, and I don’t think that’s necessarily a bad thing, but the ongoing song in my head in no longer automatically there. I can be silent inside, and sometimes just appreciate silence around me – as I am now, with no one else in the house, the cat fed (so not filling my ears with her “starved” little voice) and nothing on. No radio, no TV, no music. Just me and the sounds of my fingers clacking across the keyboard. There’s a certain comfort in that, too.</p>

			 <p>Lots to agree with in Owen Williams piece on “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Foldable phones: right tech, wrong place?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->”, starting with this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Surface Book, for example, could simply be a single ultra-thin device that folds into itself to become a slate, rather than detaching. The lower half, in &lsquo;laptop&rsquo; mode could transform into a simple display-based keyboard, and adapt dynamically to the form-factor it finds itself in at any moment.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I’m not sure about this. Part of the advantage of tablet form devices is that you don&rsquo;t have to have the additional weight and bulk of the keyboard. Surface Book works because if you take off the base, it weighs less than half as much, making it easy to use when held. Surface Pro and iPad Pro work because you can remove the keyboard altogether and still have a usable slate.</p>
<p>In theory I would love an iPad Pro that folded in half to reduce its size. In practice, that would more than double the thickness once you account for the inevitable hinge mechanism. Folding devices are just bulky devices, and who wants that?</p>
<p>Most of the tech news sites are going absolutely crazy over folding devices. I just don’t think they have any kind of use case yet. Perhaps they’ll find one, but I can think of a million technologies in the past which never made it past this stage.</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t create more than you consume. Consumption is quicker and easier by definition – it takes far longer to write a novel than for even the slowest reader to consume it. The key question is how much time you&rsquo;ve investing in each.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nick Wingfield<!-- raw HTML omitted --> mentioned something which took me back a long way:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I was tangentially involved in it. At the time, I was news editor on MacUser UK, and a year before they broke the story, Nick called me to see if I&rsquo;d heard anything about Transitive, the UK-based company whose PowerPC to Intel code translation software Apple was using.</p>
<p>Nick and Matthew worked on that story for a good 18 months before publishing anything. It was solid, dogged reporting. Calling it &ldquo;rumours&rdquo; is what Apple did at the time - basically, anything Apple didn&rsquo;t want you to report, they called &ldquo;rumours&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Worth remembering: Jobs was so pissed off about the Marklar story (and many others) that he made closing dePlume&rsquo;s site a priority - and eventually sued it out of existence. And way too many journalists covering the Mac gave Apple a free pass about this, effectively shrugging their shoulders.</p>
<p>Coda: one of our reporters, the wonderful and much missed Paul Nesbitt, asked Jobs the same question in about 2004. He got barred from Apple press conferences for it. Jobs had many fine qualities, but tolerance for a free press was not one of them.</p>
