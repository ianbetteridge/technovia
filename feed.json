				"content_text": "<p>Samantha Cole at 404 Media – <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/automattic-buyout-offer-wordpress-matt-mullenweg/\">Employees Describe an Environment of Paranoia and Fear Inside Automattic Over WordPress Chaos</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In July, before the latest WP Engine blowup, an Automattic employee wrote in Slack that they received a direct message from Mullenweg sending them an identification code for Blind, an anonymous workplace discussion platform, which was required to complete registration on the site. Blind requires employees to use their official workplace emails to sign up, as a way to authenticate that users actually work for the companies they are discussing. Mullenweg said on Slack that emails sent from Blind’s platform to employees’ email addresses were being forwarded to him. If employees wanted to log in or sign up for Blind, they’d need to ask Mullenweg for the two-factor identification code. The implication was that Automattic—and Mullenweg—could see who was trying to sign up for Blind, which is often a place where people anonymously vent or share criticism about their workplace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I cannot understand how any manager, any leader, can get themselves into a position where they believe they should <em>redirect employee email to themselves</em> in order to monitor who is signing up for a site of any kind. What’s almost worse is that to anyone with half an idea about human beings, it should be obvious this would do more harm than good:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>One Automattic employee told me that Mullenweg’s interception of Blind emails was the thing that made them start looking for a new job. “For Matt to do that, without prior announcement, was equivalent to spying on his employees. And for him to think it’s ok to tell people to message him for their verification code is ridiculous—I’ve never questioned an employer’s judgment as much as I did in that moment (although it has happened many times since),”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What Mullenweg – like all insecure leaders – appears to be craving isn’t an effective team, but a monoculture of people who believe in him, personally, and his vision. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“There is a vocal group of sycophants who are cheering on Matt’s actions via Anonymattic,” they said, “drawing favorable comparisons to how Elon Musk and Donald Trump operate. Their morale seems high, but I can’t relate.” Screenshots viewed by 404 Media show some staff having changed their Slack usernames to include “[STAYING]” to signal their support of Mullenweg and intention to remain at the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Companies that have this level of leader cult fanaticism inevitably fail. And what this monoculture entails is a situation where “the emperor’s new clothes” becomes a leadership manual, not a warning:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A recently-departed employee told me that the WP Engine legal drama wasn’t their final straw. “But in hindsight, it should have been,” they said. “The escalation since then just confirmed I made the right choice. At the time, I thought Matt might have a point about the trademarks (something I know little about), but he did say at the time he was going to treat this like a war and continue escalating it, because the truth was on his side. I guess we’re now seeing what that really meant.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<h2>1. Well who could possibly have seen this coming?</h2>\nI wrote a while ago that the era of major levels of affiliate revenue for publishers was going to come to an end within the next three to five years. Generative AI writing means both that Google is likely to become a sea of slop, and that anyone with a search engine – especially Google – is going to cream off the best quality search results for itself.\n\nAmazon is taking this a step further by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-ai-agents-shopping-guides-rufus/\">using generative AI to do product recommendations on site</a>. Given that a large number of searches for products begin on Amazon anyway, this is more bad news for anyone who makes money from sending traffic towards the Seattle company. And as users get more and more exposed to using conversation to hone down what they want, this is going to get worse for publishers who focus on “an article” as the canonical way of recommending products.\n\nThe truth is that articles have never been brilliant at recommending the right solution for any individual. For example, the answer to “what car is right for me” has always depended on your use of it. Conversational agents using good quality data will be a better solution in the long run.\n<h2>2. Turkeys, meet Christmas</h2>\nYes, I know that advertising revenue is toast, but if you are a major publisher and you’re <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/10/08/openai-hearst-ai-content-deal\">giving OpenAI the rights to mine your content</a>, you are silly. The sum of money they’re paying is never going to go up: and when your licensing deal ends, they will have used everything you have ever done to train a model which can recreate your style of content in seconds. Golf, as they say, clap.\n<h2>3. Possible sign of the end times: I agree with DHH</h2>\nDavid Heinemeier Hansson is not on my Christmas card list. He’s one of those techbros for whom the phrase “arrogant asshat” is entirely appropriate. But for once, I’m going to agree wholeheartedly with <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/automattic-is-doing-open-source-dirty-b95cf128\">something he wrote</a>: Automattic demanding a tithe from WP Engine is a violation of the ideals of open source software, reduces trust in it, and in my view shows that Matt Mullenweg’s “principles” begin and end at maintaining control over WordPress.\n<h2>4. Where all the Chief Metaverse Officers gone?</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/where-have-all-the-chief-metaverse-officers-gone/\">Good question</a>. My bet is the <a href=\"https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Golgafrinchan_Ark_Fleet_Ship_B\">B Ark</a>.\n<h2>5. Oh boy, Roblox is toast</h2>\nWhere “toast” means “<a href=\"https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/\">full of child grooming</a>”. Ouch.\n<h2>6. Quote of the week</h2>\n<blockquote>The truth is the news media is effectively in the tank for Trump, sanewashing his literal nonsense, outright lies, and violence-inspiring hate speech against even legal immigrants. But our major political news media remains so hyper-focused on appearing not to favor one political side over the other that it’s completely lost sight of what ought to be their north star: the truth.\nJohn Gruber, “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/04/why-is-smiths-motion-not-the-top-story\">Why Is Jack Smith’s Unsealed Motion, Outlining Trump’s Criminal Actions to Overturn the 2020 Election, Not the Top Story?</a>”</blockquote>\n<h2>7. Elon, phone home (from Mars)</h2>\n<blockquote>I increasingly wonder why Elon Musk is bothering trying to establish himself on Mars, and not just because it looks like a complete dump up there. (Seriously, if you think that’s beautiful, I have around a hundred thousand disused quarries I’d love to show you right here on Earth.)\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/11/hurricane-milton-elon-musk-natural-disasters\">The ever-wonderful Marina Hyde</a>, wondering what reality Musk occupies.</blockquote>\n<h2>8. I’m shocked, shocked I tell you that lovely Google would do this</h2>\nYeah no of course I’m not. Turns out that Google Pixel phones give it your location, email address and more every fifteen minutes, <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/08/water-thats-not-wet/\">without consent</a>. And no, before you say something, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/05/28/its-middle-night-do-you-know-who-your-iphone-is-talking/\">using an iPhone isn’t much a miracle cure</a>.\n<h2>9. This stuff matters</h2>\nI could have written a WordPress special edition this time out. But I wondered if that would be too “insider baseball” for most people.\n\nBut a big chunk of the internet runs on WordPress. Publishers use it a lot. It’s become the IBM of web servers: “no one ever got fired for recommending WordPress”. And the hold-outs in the publishing space who have had their own bespoke software or used something else appear to be dwindling every year.\n\nSo WordPress <em>matters</em>, to a degree that few other software platforms do. It became popular in part because it was open source, so anyone could customize it and bend it to their will, and because so many people used it that it was easy to support and find developers for. It saw off semi-forgotten closed source rivals.\n\nIf you want a summary then <a href=\"https://torment-nexus.mathewingram.com/is-matt-mullenweg-defending-wordpress-or-sabotaging-it/\">Mathew Ingram’s article is a good place to go</a>. Mathew has written something which encapsulates the feeling that I think many people have: profound disappointment in Mat Mullenweg’s behaviour, in his refusal to understand that being both the CEO of <a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://WordPress.com\">WordPress.com</a> <strong>and</strong> the effective owner of <a class=\"autolink\" href=\"https://WordPress.org\">WordPress.org</a> places him in a position which needs to be handled sensitively.

A hole is a hole</h2>\n“<a href=\"https://netwars.pelicancrossing.net/2024/10/11/a-hole-is-a-hole/\">There is no such thing as a magic hole that only good guys can use</a>”. Wendy Grossman has spent a long time pointing out that if you build a backdoor in a system to let “good guys” in law enforcement use, you’re opening the same thing for people who you would really rather not let into systems. And so it goes.\n",

				"content_text": "<h2>1. Apple’s built in apps can do (almost) everything</h2>\nOne of the characteristics of hardcore nerdery is the tendency to over engineer your systems. People spend a lot of time creating systems, tinkering with them, making them as perfect as possible, only to abandon them a few years down the line when some new shiny hotness appears.\n\nI’m as guilty of this as the next nerd, but at least I’m aware of my addiction. It’s one of the reasons why I have spent time avoiding getting sucked into the word of Notion, because I can see myself losing days (weeks) to tinkering, all the while getting nothing done.\n\nThat said, if you are going to create an entire workflow management system and you’re in the word of Apple, you could do a lot worse than <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-realist/how-i-replaced-notion-with-reminders-numbers-and-notes-38282543b29b\">take a leaf out of Joan Westenberg’s book and use all Apple’s first party apps</a>. They have now got to the point where they are superficially simple, but contain a lot of power underneath.\n\nThe downside is it’s an almost certain way of trapping yourself in Apple’s ecosystem for the rest of time. Yes, Apple’s services – which lie behind the apps – use standards and have the ability to export, but not all of them, and for how long?\n\nIt’s a trade off, and from my perspective not one that really works for me right now. But if it does for you, then it’s a good option (and better than Notion).\n<h2>2. Juno removed from the App Store</h2>\nAKA “why I do not like any company, no matter how well intentioned, to have a monopoly on software distribution for a platform.” Christian Selig <a href=\"https://christianselig.com/2024/10/juno-removed/\">created a YouTube player for the Apple Vision Pro</a>. It doesn’t block ads or do anything which could be regarded as dubious. But Google claimed it was using its trademarks, and Apple removed it.\n\nWhy is this problematic? Because it’s setting Apple up as a judge in a legal case. YouTube could, and should, have gone to a judge if it believed it had a legal case for trademark violation. That’s what judges are for. Instead, probably because it knew that it wouldn’t win a case like that, it went to Apple. Apple (rightly) doesn’t want to get involved in trademark disputes, so it shrugged and removed the app.\n\nThis extra-legal application of law is one of the most nefarious impacts of App Store monopolies. And if it continues to be allowed, it will only get worse.\n<h2>3. The horrible descent of Matt Mullenweg</h2>\nYou will be aware of the conflict between WordPress — by which we mean Matt Mullenweg, because according to Matt he <strong>is</strong> WordPress — and WPEngine. I have <em>many</em> opinions on this which I will, at some point, get down to writing. The most important one is simple: if you make an open source product under the GPL, you don’t get to dictate to anyone how they use it and don’t get to attempt to punish them for not contributing “enough”. Heck, you don’t get to decide what “enough” looks like.\n\nThe whole thing has brought out the worst in Mullenweg, <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kelliepeterson/nice-guy-matt-mullenweg-ceo-of-wordpress-com-cries-foul-and-threatens-me-with-legal-action-f116ac57d862\">as evidenced in his attacks on Kellie Peterson</a>. Peterson, who is a former Automattic employee, offered to help anyone leaving WordPress find opportunities. Mullenweg decided this was attacking him, and claimed this was illegal. I don’t know about you, but when a multi-millionaire starts to throw around words like “tortuous interference” I pay attention.\n\nAs with many of that generation of California ideologists Mullenweg appears to have decided that he knows best, now and always. Yes, private equity companies that use open source projects and contribute nothing back are douchebags, but they’re douchebags who are doing something that the principles of open source explicitly allow them to do. Mullenweg’s apparent desire to be the emperor of WordPress is worrying.\n<h2>4. OpenAI raises money, still isn’t a business</h2>\nEd Zitron wrote an excellent piece this week on <a href=\"https://www.wheresyoured.at/oai-business/\">the crazy valuation and funding round which OpenAI just closed</a>, pointing out that (1) ChatGPT loses money on every customer, and (2) there is no way to use scale to change this: the company is going to keep losing money on every customer as models get more compute-hungry. Neither Moore’s Law nor the economies of scale which made cloud services of the past profitable are going to come riding to the rescue.\n\nI think Ed’s right — and it’s important to note, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceb09314-179c-4208-ab0b-4d24de706716\">as Satya Nadella did</a>, that LLMs are moving into the “commodity” stage — but one other thing to note is that many of the more simple things which people use LLMs for are being pushed from cloud to edge. Apple’s “Apple Intelligence” is one example of this, but Microsoft is also pushing a lot of the compute down to the device level in the ARM-based Copilot PCs.\n\nThis trend should alleviate some of the growth issues that OpenAI has, but it’s a double-edged sword because it makes it less likely that someone will need to use ChatGPT, and so even less likely to need to pay OpenAI.\n<h2>5. Why I love Angela Carter</h2>\nI think I first read Angela Carter during my degree, one of the few books that I bothered to read for my literature modules<sup><a id=\"fnr1-26535\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn1-26535\">1</a></sup>. <a href=\"https://countercraft.substack.com/p/angela-carter-and-the-so-fucking\">This piece</a> includes possibly my favourite quote from her: “Okay, I write overblown, purple, self-indulgent prose. So fucking what?”\n\nAnd the point is: sometimes it’s fine not to be subtle. Sometimes it’s fine to be overblown. Sometimes the story demands it, like a steak needs to be juicy.\n<h2>6. And speaking of writers I love</h2>\nI can’t tell you enough to just go and read M John Harrison. <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781474624923\">Climbers</a></em> is sometimes regarded as his best novel, and this essay on <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-best-novel-about-21st-century-male-loneliness-was-written-in-1989/\">why it’s the best book written about 21st century male loneliness despite being written in 1989</a> captures a lot of it. I like the line from Robert Macfarlane’s introduction: “To Harrison, all life is alien”. Amen to that.\n<h2>7. No really this week is all lit, all the time</h2>\nOlivia Laing is another writer that makes me salivate when I read her. Like Harrison and Carter, her prose is as good as her fiction, and her recent book <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781529066708\">The Garden Against Time</a></em> – an account of restoring a garden to glory – is one of the best yet. If you need any further persuading, you should <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/olivia-laing-the-garden-against-time-book-review\">read this piece in the New Yorker</a>.\n<h2>8. Down in Brighton? Like books?</h2>\nNext weekend is the best-named literary festival in the world down in Brighton. <a href=\"https://coastisqueer.com\">The Coast is Queer</a> includes loads of brilliant sessions including <a href=\"https://coastisqueer.com/event/queer-fantastical-reimaginings/\">queer fantastical reimaginings</a>, <a href=\"https://coastisqueer.com/event/world-building-with-julia-armfield-and-real-writers-circle/\">the incredible Julia Armfield on world building</a>, <a href=\"https://coastisqueer.com/event/juno-dawsons-lovely-trans-literary-salon-with-kuchenga-shenje/\">Juno Dawson’s trans literary salon</a>, and <a href=\"https://coastisqueer.com/event/the-coast-is-queer-cabaret/\">the unmissable David Hoyle</a>. I’m going, you should go.\n<h2>9. Harlan the terrible</h2>\nLike Cory Doctorow, I grew up <em>worshipping</em> Harlan Ellison. And like Cory, as I’ve grown older I have see that Harlan was an incredibly complicated person. <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/05/farrago/\">Cory has written a great piece</a> (masquerading as just one part of a linkblog) which not only looks at Harlan, warts and all, but also talks about the genesis of the story he contributed to the – finally finished! – <em><a href=\"https://www.blackstonepublishing.com/products/book-fyhm\">Last Dangerous Visions</a></em>.\n<h2>10. Argh Mozilla wai u doo this?</h2>\nNo Mozilla, no, online advertising does not need “<a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/improving-online-advertising/\">improving… through product and infrastructure</a>”. Online advertising needs to understand that surveillance-based ads were always toxic and the whole thing needs to be torn up. <a href=\"https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/10/mozillas-ceo-doubles-down-on-them-being-an-advertising-company-now/\">I agree with Jamie Zawinski</a>: Mozilla should be “building THE reference implementation web browser, and being a jugular-snapping attack dog on standards committees.”\n\nTo be clear: I think Mozilla’s goals are laudable, in the sense that at the moment the choice for people is either accept being tracked to a horrendous degree or just block almost every ad and tracker. But you can’t engineer your way around the advertising industry’s rapacious desire for data. It’s that industry which needs to change, not the technology.\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n \t<li id=\"fn1-26535\">I read a lot, I just didn’t read a lot that was actually on the syllabus. <a class=\"reversefootnote\" title=\"return to article\" href=\"#fnr1-26535\">↩︎</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n",

Kevin was right then – Apple could have owned web video – and someone really needs to sit down and write the history of that part of the company’s story. How did they mess up? As Kevin puts it “they invented pop-up web ads, and put one in before playing any web QT movie to sell the 'Pro' version of the player. They crippled the QT Player to remove the editing features unless you paid - even for the Mac users who had had the benefit before.” A lesson for today’s Apple, too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.

It’s not the only one of Future’s tech brands to be shuttered: AnandTech, the technology brand which had one of the best reputations in the world, <a href=\"https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/digital-journalism/future-closes-titles-and-events-deemed-low-to-no-growth-assets/\">is also going</a> although its archive will stay online for the foreseeable future. I’m not surprised – while both sites were well regarded, they were not a great fit for the affiliate-led strategy that Future has been pursuing for many years (where it was ahead of most publishers). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. “Pray we don’t alter the deal further”</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the reasons I loathe – and I really do mean that – the current generation of tech giants is their ability to lock down markets for software and pull the rug out from under existing application developers. The latest example is iA, which has effectively killed off the Android version of its wonderful writing app iA Writer <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/our-android-app-is-frozen-in-carbonite\">after Google changed the rules regarding letting applications access Google Drive</a>. “In order to get our users full access to their Google Drive on their devices, we now needed to pass a yearly CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) audit. This requires hiring a third-party vendor like KPMG.” Yes, that’s right: pay an auditor maybe a couple of months of revenue in order to access cloud storage. But it’s not just Google: Apple has the same control, as iA point out in a footnote.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Halide rejected from the App Store</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No really, it’s not just Google. After seven years, and despite being featured in the iPhone 16 keynote, <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/09/24/halide-rejected-from-the-app-store/\">an update to Halide was rejected from Apple’s App Store</a> because its permissions prompt wasn’t explicit enough that the app, which is a camera app and takes pictures, was in fact a camera app which takes pictures. <a href=\"https://x.com/sdw/status/1838652427668722100?s=61\">Apple admitted this was a mistake</a>, but how many “mistakes” never get corrected because the app isn’t high profile enough to get the right level of attention?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Why this blog will be moving soon</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m not a massive fan of WP Engine as a company, and I wouldn’t recommend them as a WordPress host for a bunch of small reasons, but I have no doubt at all that Matt Mullenweg’s apparent crusade against them is one of the hollowest and most disingenuous set of complaints I have seen in a long time. <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/09/24/automattic-vs-wp-engine/\">Pulling the rug out from users getting security updates</a> is an unforgiveable move. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This blog is hosted by WordPress.com, and I don’t particularly want to move back to self-hosting WordPress. Anyone got any recommendations?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Return to work and die</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/27/sharpen-your-blades-boys/\">I mean, literally die</a>. For four days.

Remember the TouchPad?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://tedium.co/2020/03/31/hp-touchpad-history\">This one is a definite trip down memory lane</a>: The HP TouchPad was a WebOS tablet that had many of the attributes necessary to compete with the iPad, and yet was dumped by HP 49 days after its release. And I had completely forgotten that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuN1-pRFkLU\">Russell Brand did an advert for it</a>. Oh boy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9.

If you don’t know about it, it’s a new Linux desktop environment which has been created as part of the next big upgrade to PopOS, the distribution created by computer maker System76 for its range of machine. I’m using it on my ThinkPad, and – so far at least – it's been stable and very usable considering its alpha status. I’ve seen release versions of open source products be less stable. I might write something longer about my experience of Cosmic DE as I use it more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Douchebros want to ruin bars, now</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes I really wish that the idea of “disruption” in business had never been invented, because it really does attract some of the worst ideas.

I was working at Apple in IS&amp;T in 1990, and we had a session one afternoon showing everyone the world of the future. Of course, Knowledge Navigator took pride of place, but also shown off was an early version of a revolutionary new multimedia technology which would allow you to play video, in real time, in colour, on your Mac. QuickTime.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was also there for the launch of QuickTime 3.0 in 1998, although all I remember of that event was the use of Sarah McLachlan’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QUq72fla3o\"><em>Building a Mystery</em></a> video (possibly one of the most 90s pieces of film ever made).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And, in 2001, on the top floor of the Dennis Publishing office I sat in the corner and tried to work as on screen a postage-stamp sized QuickTime video showed me a live feed of first one then two planes hitting the World Trade Center. A handful of years before the towers had been beacons as a train swung into New York, bringing me from Boston to Manhattan and into the best city in the world for the very first time. Even at QuickTime size, I felt like I was watching a friend take their last breath.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>QuickTime, then, is woven through many memories for me. Anyway, Howard Oakley has written <a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2024/09/14/a-brief-history-of-quicktime/\">a brief history of it</a>, and as a technology it probably deserves more. As a carrier of memory, it definitely means more to me. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Go to your room!</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sooner or later, your parents tell you to clean up your room. While Apple is now a middle aged company its recent descent into teenage tantrum behaviour has finally caused the EU to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/apple-faces-eu-warning-to-open-up-iphone-operating-system\">lose patience, ground it, and demand it thinks about its future conduct</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Editing vs accreting</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Me and John Gruber have our disagreements but I couldn’t agree more with almost everything in his article on <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_things_they_carried\">the difference between Tim Cook’s Apple and Steve Jobs’ Apple</a>. I would compare Jobs to a brilliant magazine editor, pulling together and inspiring creative people while also <em>editing</em>: taking out what it’s needed to tell the story. Cook, on the other hand, is someone who accretes, who adds on more stuff in order to build. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. No, Larry, no</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Larry Ellison has always had an interesting reputation in Silicon Valley. Extraordinarily rich after Oracle became the data foundation of almost everything in the world, Ellison has a kind of noxiously playful arrogance. One of the most stomach-turning episodes of Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs hagiography involves Ellison and Jobs playing a prank call on an Apple fan, first offering him a job, then laughingly turning down the poor sap. It’s gross. And it’s <em>very</em> Ellison. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With great money comes great stupidity, and it’s worth considering that as context when you read about Ellison’s view that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/09/omnipresent-ai-cameras-will-ensure-good-behavior-says-larry-ellison/\">pervasive surveillance cameras will bring world peace, or something</a>. A man so divorced from a world which doesn’t involved super yachts, billionaire friends and the ability to buy as many Miata’s as you want (if you know, you know) is not someone that the world should listen to about the future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Where the iPad ends</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don’t think there is a device which divides opinion more than the iPad. I see this in myself: there are days when I absolutely love my iPad Pro and everything that it represents. A device which can transform into anything you want it to be, that’s simple to use, that has a screen which is better than anything you own. And then there are days when I <em>hate</em> it. Not because of how it works, but because the degree of control over the experience of computing which it represents is an antithesis of many of my values. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But. There’s something about it, and I think this <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90465466/why-the-ipad-is-still-shaping-the-future-of-computing\">archive article by Tim Bajarin</a> from the iPad’s tenth anniversary on the device’s influence is worth reading. How pervasive is the iPad’s influence now? In some senses, the use of ARM and amazing displays which are clearly the direction that computers are going in probably represents its deepest impact so far. Yes, touch screens are common in the Windows world, but slate-style computers haven’t really taken off in the way they should have. I’m still typing this on a Mac, after all. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Engagement bait</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Been on Threads lately? You’ll have noticed that the main feed is <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/engagement-bait-threads/\">a torrent of engagement bait</a>. Of course you can switch to look at just the people you follow, but Meta makes every effort to pull you back into the “For You” feed, which shows you what appears to be a random mix of stupid questions and inane comments, written by people who pull on engagement like lungs pull on air. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly, anecdote from the blue side of the Meta empire notes the home feed in Facebook is now showing more and more “content” from pages, groups and pretty much anything except the people you want to see: your friends and family, the ones you love, and an occasional cute dachshund. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why, though? Speculating wildly, I think both Threads and the Facebook home feed represent a desperate bid for novelty. The action in terms of keeping you in touch with the people you’re close to has moved elsewhere, into different kinds of messenger application both private (iMessage, WhatsApp) and semi-public (Telegram). What’s left for Facebook? Pictures of old dogs? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And Threads is attempting to defining itself as “not Twitter”, while also trying to appeal to the same kinds of core influencers – journalists, those who aren’t visual enough for Insta. What better way to win than rigging the game towards a stream of infinite engagement bait?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Death to all Word</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s 11 years since <a href=\"https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html\">Charlie Stross wrote about how he hated Microsoft Word</a>. It’s still a great read, and Charlie’s point – that until Microsoft Word dies, it’s unavoidable – remains as sound as ever. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. You put the Lime in the coconut</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love electric bikes. I own one, and it’s got me back into cycling. So I’m in favour of people using them. But… well, is it just me or do techbros ruin <em>everything?</em> In this case, Lime and other e-bike rental companies are essentially creating fat rideable litter across areas to such a degree that local authorities want them banned, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2024/sep/15/i-want-them-all-crushed-the-council-poised-to-ban-dangerous-lime-bikes\">local residents want them crushed.</a> The bikes, not the techbros. Although hey, if that’s what the people want…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Fashion</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s an unlikely thing for a boy from Derby, part of the post-industrial hinterland that is the East Midlands, to love fashion. But I always have. I think it was fashion that first made me love magazines, the heft and visual delight of something like <em>Vogue</em>. When I became an editor of a magazine which, while a tech mag, was also read by a huge number of creative people in design, it was probably the best job I ever had – even if I didn’t know it at the time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still love magazines, which is why I absolutely adored “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ksN_8zPJR0\">In Vogue: The 90s</a>”, a documentary about the eponymous magazine and the the era that made me. Highly recommended. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Art for art’s sake</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I spent five years working on a PhD thesis titled <em>The implications of Kant’s philosophy of mind for artificial intelligence</em>in the early 90s, when cognitive science – that blend of philosophy, computing and psychology - was probably at its academic height. But like Kant, my interests in philosophy were broad, and I spent a chunk of my time in both medical ethics and the philosophy of art. <a href=\"http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-10/conservation-ethics-workshop/\">The paper I presented to the conservators of the V&amp;A</a> on analogies from principles in medical ethics is long lost, but I’m glad that my comparison of the principle of dignity in death being more important than the relentless preservation of life with conservation of art works didn’t stick too heavily in anyone’s mind. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve realised lately quite how much a blend of technology, art and design has influenced my working practice. I’m not an artist – words are the only medium that I have ever found which I have any talent at – but I love art, and artists, and design, and designers. I love how they see the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s probably why I love <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/42244/1/how-to-jenny-saville-british-painting-most-expensive-living-female-artist-tate\">this interview with Jenny Saville</a> much. Saville is one of those artists whose work you would instantly recognise, but whose face you might not remember. And in particular, I love this quote:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I paint, I don’t search for beauty, but for the power of life’s force: when you fall in love with someone, it's life’s force. When you see amazing food or you listen to music that goes right inside your body, that’s life’s force. That moment is not an intellectual space, it's something beyond – you can't articulate it. It’s about the moments that help you breathe deeper.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s a good one to ponder on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/3aed3e394d.jpg\"> <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/62058f1f93.jpg\"> \n",

				"content_text": "<h2>1. Oh was there some new Apple stuff?</h2>\nApparently there was. I didn’t get chance to watch the keynote live — I was in Amsterdam for a conference — but the only thing that really stood out for me when I saw it later was the feature for AirPods Pro <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24241960/apple-airpods-pro-2-otc-hearing-aid-health-industry\">which allows them to function as a proper hearing aid</a>. My old ears will thank Apple for it (and so will my bank manager, as I won’t have to spend around £1,000 on something I don’t need most of the time).\n<h2>2. Private cloud compute</h2>\nAnd speaking of new Apple stuff, I’m actually pretty impressed with the way that <a href=\"https://archive.is/Gasef\">Apple has implemented its private cloud compute</a> system. Yeah, I know, AI is evil and all that.\n<h2>3. How an iPhone screen repair led to a social media ban</h2>\nHowever, back in the world of older Apple stuff, <a href=\"https://www.finnvoorhees.com/words/banned-iphone\">this whole story is likely to make your jaw hit the floor</a>. After Apple replaced Finn Voorhees’ iPhone screen, they found when trying to log into Snapchat they got a an “SS06: Device Banned” error message. It turned out that the phone Finn got was a refurb (which should be fine) but that the previous owner had been banned from the service – and Snapchat uses a little-known feature to lock out not only the user, but the device if someone is banned. Unfortunately this device ban flag persists even if the phone is factory reset.\n<h2>4. The new Reeder</h2>\nOne of the things which keeps pulling back to using the Mac, iPad and iPhone is thethird party developer ecosystem. This, of course, is one of the reasons why I end up getting angry at Apple for wanting their pound of flesh from every developer. It’s not the Mac that keeps me on the Mac. It’s the <em>developers</em>. Apple should be paying them, not the other way round.\n\nAnyway, <a href=\"https://reederapp.com\">Reeder</a> has been one of my favourite Mac and iOS applications for a long time. It’s an RSS reader (the clue is in the name) that’s a <em>beautiful</em> piece of design.\n\n<a href=\"https://gloria.social/@rizzi\">Silvio Rizzo</a>, its author, has rebuilt the app from the ground up to change its focus and, as he puts it, make it something that’s “rebuilt for today”.\n\nWhat does that mean? The starting point is that the way we get information is no longer all about RSS. In fact, we get feeds from social media, from YouTube, from podcasts, and many other places.\n\nSo Reeder now supports all of the above, putting everything into a single feed. It’s still a lovely design, but I suspect this approach won’t be for everyone. It reminds me of the “<a href=\"http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html\">river of news</a>” concept that Dave Winer was talking about more than a decade ago. I’m not sure if I like it yet, but I am going to give it a go.\n<h2>5. iA Writer keeps getting better</h2>\nInformation Architects – iA – are one of my favourite developer teams. Not only do they produce great apps, they’re good people too. iA Writer, which was their first and flagship product, is the best distraction-free Markdown writing application that exists.\n\nBut it’s had one small weakness which means I don’t use it for as much as I would want: it’s not really designed to handle long-form articles made up from smaller pieces, whether that’s a novel or book-length project of just something composed from small parts. It can do transclusion in writing, and that’s a useful feature, but it’s not quite what I need.\n\nA case in point: although the tools I use to write these linkblog posts vary, I often use Ulysses for it. I will write each of the ten blue links in a separate document, allowing me to go as short or long as I want without distraction. Then I just number them, move them into the right order, and publish direct to Wordpress.\n\nI can’t quite do that with iA Writer — yet. I could create each document separately, but in order to make a single document which I could publish in one click, I would have to create a document, use the transclusion feature to “insert” all the elements, and publish it. It’s just a little less elegant than the same process on Ulysses.\n\nThe good news is that <a href=\"https://ia.net/topics/faster-filing-with-tree-view-a-step-forward-for-large-writing-projects\">it’s moving closer to having the right tools for the job</a>. The latest version includes a “tree view” for files in its sidebar, making it significantly easier to structure texts. I’m really looking forward to what they do next.\n<h2>6. One for the book pile</h2>\n<a href=\"https://books.by/john-buck\">This looks like essential reading</a>: an amazing collection of interview and anecdotes from the hackers and nerds who made all the most amazing Apple technology (<a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/sponsor/inventing-the-future-sep-13/\">via Nick Heer</a>, where I get a lot of my best links from.)\n<h2>7. Ice. Ice. Baby</h2>\nWhen the wonderful Mac menu bar app <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/link/2024/06/bartender-has-a-new-owner/\">Bartender was sold</a> there was a little bit of concern that the new owner wouldn’t, perhaps, be the best steward for it. But if you want an app to manage all the clutter in your menubar then <a href=\"https://icemenubar.app\">look no further than Ice</a>. Not only is it really good, <a href=\"https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice\">it’s also open source</a>. Recommended.\n<h2>8. Spamming the regulator</h2>\nLook this is nerdy as hell, but you know I love a little bit of light reading about competition law. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/antitrust/article-abstract/12/1/7/7128249?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;login=false\">This paper</a> looks at a new tactic from big companies who are under investigation for antitrust violation: gathering together so many thousands of pages of evidence and expert testimony that the case either becomes logjammed forever, or the regulator and judges can’t properly evaluate the evidence.\n<h2>9. Rage bait on Threads</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/threads-meta-engagement-rage-bait-viral-katie-notopoulos-i-tried-2024-9\">It’s a problem</a>. For me Threads is mostly unusable junk because the “For you” view is swamped by engagement bait and nonsense. I’m happy that mostly I can now follow the people I want to follow who are only active on Threads from my Mastodon account, but I would love for Meta to actually realise this is a problem and engage with it. The service will go down the toilet pretty fast if it doesn’t.\n<h2>10. America’s best paid CEOs have the worst paid employees</h2>\n<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/09/low-wage-100/\">I’m sure this is a complete coincidence</a> and the money will trickle down Real Soon Now.\n",

What a great win for Margrethe Vestager, making clear to the world that the EU is hostile to successful companies. Good job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/10/23/ireland-identified-as-one-of-worlds-top-tax-havens/\">Ireland has long had a reputation as, effectively, an in-EU tax haven</a> -- one which walked very close to the line of EU and international law And the country has been especially \"favourable\" to large tech companies. <a href=\"https://www.independent.ie/opinion/editorial/editorial-ecj-ruling-on-13bn-rotten-apple-deal-exposes-unfairness-of-irelands-tax-rules/a1600405713.html\">As the Irish Independent notes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Government continues to claim there was no special treatment for Apple, and these were all ­merely legitimate tax exemptions. The ECJ says otherwise, with its final judgment: “Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid, which Ireland is required to recover.” The judges ruled that Apple’s two units incorporated in Ireland enjoyed favourable tax treatment compared with resident companies taxed in Ireland that were not capable of benefiting from such advance rulings by the tax authorities here. A rotten deal, indeed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the Irish government itself has long known that its sweetheart deals <a href=\"https://archive.is/gDWqJ#selection-1733.0-1733.208\">weren't up to international standards</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As finance minister from 2017, Paschal Donohoe wisely started a process of bringing Irish rules into line – including rolling back the IP reliefs – and eventually signed up to the new OECD corporate tax deal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ironically -- and counter to John's point -- the conversation in Ireland is already about how to use the windfall from Apple to invest in infrastructure which will help maintain its position as a hub in the EU for tech businesses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And then there is what Ireland can – and cannot – offer. Promises – about clean energy, top-class education, abundant water and so on – count for little now. The State has the resources to address this, helped by another €14 billion which will soon be resting in our account. But the question investors are asking is whether Ireland can actually deliver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not just tax, of course. Ireland has also been recognised as the most lax data protection regime in Europe, so much so that the EDPB was forced to step in and <a href=\"https://www.edpb.europa.eu/news/news/2023/12-billion-euro-fine-facebook-result-edpb-binding-decision_en\">make the Irish DPA</a> <em>enforce its own rules</em> against Meta. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/22/facebook-eu-fine\">John's reaction to that case was a little different</a>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "I could -- and probably should -- write an entire essay about the cult of the founder in Silicon Valley, how it developed and the damage it has done. <a href=\"https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/paul-graham-and-the-cult-of-the-founder?r=eeyg&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true\">This article from Dave Karpf</a>, though, encapsulates some of my own thinking. Contrasting Aaron Swartz and Sam Altman -- both members of the first Ycombinator cohort -- is such an interesting approach.\n\nBut the other reason why <a href=\"https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html\">the whole founder mode thing</a> is a hot mess is that Paul Graham is entirely wrong about management and leadership. Yeah, I know: Graham has been involved with building more companies than I have. But he's never actually run, or even been in a senior leadership role, in a large company.\n\nThere's a key paragraph in his essay which I think shows this:\n<blockquote>Hire good people and give them room to do their jobs. Sounds great when it's described that way, doesn't it? Except in practice, judging from the report of founder after founder, what this often turns out to mean is: hire professional fakers and let them drive the company into the ground.</blockquote>\n<em>If you are hiring \"professional fakers\" that means you are a poor manager</em>. One of the most important thing that leaders focus on is hiring the right people, and that takes experience, or training, or both. Founders tend to lack all of these things, so <em>of course</em> they don't always hire great people. And even good leaders don't have a 100% hit rate (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Browett\">John Browett anybody?</a>). <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/11/business/founder-mode-meaning-vs-manager-nightcap/index.html\">As Allison Morrow puts it</a>, founder mode is just another way of telling toxic bosses they are really great. And lord knows, that is not what Silicon Valley needs right now.\n\nAnother tell on Graham's lack of experience in this area: his lack of knowledge that companies other than Steve Jobs' Apple run annual retreats for the 100 most influential people, regardless of level. As Karpf notes, many companies do this. Heck, I have been part of retreats like that even at old-school publishing companies.\n\nBut if you have never worked in large companies, and you have the kind of founder myopia that Graham has, you wouldn't know that.\n\nI think Dave gets it right when he connects founder mode with other Silicon Valley craziness:\n<blockquote>This is all of a piece with Andreessen’s techno-optimist manifesto and Balaji Srinivasan’s bat shit bitcoin declarations. A small, cloistered elite of not-especially-bright billionaires have decided that they are very, exceptional, and that the problem with society these days is that people keep treating them like everyone else.</blockquote>\nI think all this also relates to <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@neil.cybart/post/C_0mBaEv1-T?xmt=AQGzzwSPPkozoerDUOhTLGvzP1T_x9G6S-F8gyT7yTlgeQ\">a post on Threads by Neil Cybart</a>:\n<blockquote>One thing I have noticed is that some people in tech (writers, journalists, etc.) are becoming tired. Seems like it started around the pandemic. They have lost interest. However, they think the issue is Big Tech becoming boring instead of themselves. A good sign that it may be time for a re-shifting of voices in tech. I think we are going to see that play out in the coming years.</blockquote>\nI have been thinking about Neil's post a lot since I read it (always the sign of a good post!), in part because I too have felt bored by tech. Given that I have been fascinated by tech for almost the whole of my life, that has felt like a pretty odd place to be, mentally.\n\nBut I don't think it's that people themselves are getting boring: it's that the landscape and characters in tech coverage have become more one dimensional. The hype cycle driven by characters like Graham often feels like you are being bludgeoned around the head if you're not \"all in\" on crypto, or the metaverse, or LLMs, or whatever.\n\nAnd the personalities -- and tech is, and always has been, as much about people as things -- are cartoon villains/heroic founders (delete as appropriate) who live in a bubble of their own. Musk, Graham, Altman… you name it.\n\nTech has become all Jobs and no Woz. As Dave Karpf rightly identifies, the hacker has vanished from the scene, to be replaced by an endless array of know-nothing hero founders whose main superpower is the ability to bully subordinates (and half of Twitter) into believing they are always right.\n\nWhere the hackers exist, they are either buried in the depths of big companies (does Johny Srouji ever leave that pristine basement?) or working on interesting but niche open source projects, often involving writing yet another text editor.\n\nIn allowing and encouraging the likes of Graham to define what tech looks like, we have made tech look boring, unless you are the kind of teenage who dreams of getting rich quick by starting a company, riding a hype cycle, and flipping it to some sucker for a few hundred million.\n\nI doubt that commentators who love technology are bored with tech.

The DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government a step closer to launching a formal complaint.\"</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Seeking information about a company's conduct is precisely what the DoJ should be doing in any area where a dominant player is emerging, and the earlier it does that, the easier it becomes to make a case which has an actual impact. No one seriously doubts that Nvidia is now dominant in the market for AI processors. Is \"AI processors\" a market? Has Nvidia's conduct stepped over the line from tough competition to abuse of a market position? These are elements that an investigation should try to find out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What the DOJ is clearly signalling, here, is it won't allow dominance to be abused even when companies have only recently crossed the line from being a competitor to dominance. Given the speed at which technology companies can distort markets and crush competition when they achieve dominance (who remembers DR-DOS?) this feels like a sensible approach. The other option -- giving businesses 10–20 years of the ability to destroy competitors not through making the best products but by sheer force of accumulated power -- has demonstrably stifled competition. And competition drives innovation (at least in theory).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ben's best argument is that Nvidia has done nothing wrong, and in fact has done what we want companies to do: make long-term, industry - changing and fundamentally risky bets to achieve huge returns. And I agree! There is no doubt that Nvidia deserves the billions of dollars in profits it will make from being the biggest and best player in AI processors. The lead it has created from the investments it made will last for a long time, and generate a lot of money. Jensen Huang deserves all the credit he gets, and as many sharp black leather jackets as he cares to wear.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For anyone who has grown up in the era of the hero/founder and \"startup in a garage\" vision of Silicon Valley, I think it's a compelling view. Apple is another example. Under Steve Jobs, they made a series of \"bet the company\" product launches, culminating in the iPhone. They created a platform which over a billion people use globally, spending tens of billions of dollars a year on apps. Don't they <em>deserve</em> 30% of that, <em>forever</em>?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But one of the principles of Silicon Valley entrepreneurship was that success has to be <strong>continually</strong> earned. Andy Grove, who knew a thing or two about it, warned against \"the inertia of success\" because, even if you are at the top, you don't deserve anything unless you keep innovating, keep creating the best products. \"Only the paranoid survive\" because somewhere out there, a smaller, more nimble competitor is coming to eat you – and all your past success will not save you from that fate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A company getting it right does not give it some kind of permanent licence to coast while printing money. The question that all antitrust seeks to answer is simple: how much is enough? When do the well-deserved riches and power that accumulate to companies that make big bets, execute well, and invest wisely start to be toxic for society or humanity as a whole, and for competition itself? Are the riches that the largest companies make earned, or are they simply the product of being large? If it's the former, great! But if it's the latter…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The founders of the British East India company also did everything we hope our greatest companies will do: they had a long-term vision, they innovated relentlessly to find new markets, and when a world-changing opportunity presented itself, they were ready to take advantage of it, for a long-term detriment that may forever be unmeasurable.

Model collapse isn’t just for AI</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When a large language model starts to ingest a lot of content written by either itself or other large language models, it falls into what’s called <em>model collapse</em>: a state where, like a snake eating its own tail, it no longer makes sense. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back when I was working on the philosophy of AI in the 1990s, one of the strands of study was using computers to understand human behaviour by creating models and seeing if the quirks of us meat sacks would emerge from the model. And I would argue that model collapse is one of these quirks. If the information you are exposed to is limited to an echo chamber, then you see the same kind of behaviour in people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unfortunately – but predictably – <a href=\"https://www.reimaginingliberty.com/silicon-valleys-very-online-ideologues-are-in-model-collapse/\">the “super-smart” Silicon Valley billionaires are just as susceptible to model collapse as either an LLM or every other human</a>. Only, unlike most people (and most LLMs) the damage they can do because of this model collapse is actually enormous. Musk, Andreessen, Thiel and the rest have created a model of the world which bears no relation to reality, but unfortunately, they have it in their power to influence the world so it matches their views. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. RIP AnandTech</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At its height, AnandTech was the best site around for deep, highly researched reviews of significant products. As such, it was an outlier as technology product writing moved to an affiliate-based revenue model which focused on lists of potential options for purchase. It had more akin to the technology publishing landscape that I learned the trade in, where products were tested (occasionally to destruction) in labs by people who focused on devising ever more fiendish methods of working out how a product would perform in the real world. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.anandtech.com/show/21542/end-of-the-road-an-anandtech-farewell\">I’m sad to see it go</a>, but at least it doesn’t have to suffer the same fate as so many other sites which have simply been used as fodder for boosting the SEO rankings of lesser brands. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Monoculture is mono failure</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Diversity, as anyone smart knows, is strength. That applies to farming. It applies to organisations. And it applies to platforms. Diversity protects you from the impact of monocultures, which inevitably contain the seeds of their own downfall.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And yet, the technological systems we currently have implicitly rewarded monocultures, monopolies and monopsonies. Wherever you look, <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/ideas/technology/67625/when-monoculture-leads-to-monofailure\">from hardware systems</a> to social media platforms to online retailing, we are creating failure points through a lack of diversity. CrowdStrike is just the latest example, but 21st century capitalism’s addiction to the <a href=\"https://wiki.c2.com/?HighlanderPrinciple=\">Highlander Principle</a> (“there can be only one!”) is going to present some profound problems over the next few decades. Assuming of course we survive them at all…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. I just wish Bluesky was actually a federated system</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bluesky, the “not Twitter” that isn’t either Mastodon or Threads, has seen an influx of users from both Britain and now Brazil as people become more and more annoyed with Elon Musk. But it’s also been focusing on some fascinating approaches to content moderation and protecting users. The latest is the ability, if a post of yours is quoted, to <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/bluesky-anti-toxicity/\">“decouple” the post from the quote</a> – effectively stopping in its tracks one commonly used method of abuse, the “quote tweet pile-on”. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I still don’t like that it’s not, yet, truly federated: you can’t run your own server, and even if you use a name based on your own domain you can’t move servers no matter what. But I like that they are experimenting with different options. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. JISC leaving Twitter</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And speaking of leaving Twitter, <a href=\"https://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/all/our-statement-on-leaving-x-twitter\">JISC announced it would be ceasing activity on there</a>. The organisation is “the UK digital, data and technology agency focused on tertiary education, research and innovation”, a non-profit which drives digital transformation in education in the UK. It’s a big deal that it no longer believes being active on Twitter is in alignment with its values. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. The NeXT IPO that never happened</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/08/27/the-next-ipo-that-never-happened/\">Via Michael Tsai</a>, this is not only <a href=\"https://computerhistory.org/blog/next-steve-jobs-dot-com-ipo-that-never-happened/\">a great little potted history of NeXT</a>, the company that effectively did a reverse takeover of Apple (and ruined my 30th birthday), but also reveals that it was at one point planning an IPO. The thing that made an IPO possible wasn’t the hardware (NeXT was out of that market) or NeXTSTEP/OPENSTEP. Instead it was WebObjects, the web development platform which made creating complex dynamic sites much more easy than before. At the beginnings of the Dotcom boom, this was a major potential business. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Extra bonus fact: Dell apparently used WebObjects to create its online store in just four weeks. That, at the time, was incredible. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Moof!</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2024/08/31/a-brief-history-of-clarus-the-dogcow/\">If you know, you know</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Starship Stormtroopers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was far too young to read <em>New Worlds</em> magazine, but by my early teens I had moved on from Tolkien to Michael Moorcock, borrowing the Dorian Hawkmoon and Corum Jhaelen Irsei series from the local library and being absolutely amazed by the sheer muscularity of the writing. At some point – and I can’t remember where I found it – I read Moorcock’s “<a href=\"https://libcom.org/article/starship-stormtroopers-michael-moorcock\">Starship Stormtroopers</a>” essay on the fascistic nature of much of the Science Fiction canon, and that was it: my life – and my politics – changed for good. I became a teenage anarchist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m not sure if I am still one today (the teenage bit, definitely not) but I occasionally reread the essay, just to remind myself that it’s OK Not To Like Frank Herbert.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. The best novel about 21st Century male loneliness</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second of the holy trinity of <em>New Worlds</em> writers that changed my view of fiction was, of course, M John Harrison. There’s an argument to be made that Harrison is our best living writer, although I’m sure that he would hate anyone for making it. Harrison was unique at the time for not allowing genre to dictate what he should write, and <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/climbers-with-an-introduction-by-robert-macfarlane-m-john-harrison/5823090?ean=9781474624923\"><em>Climbers</em></a>, his 1989 novel about rock climbing in Yorkshire, saw him walk a long way out of science fiction without breaking a step. It’s a brilliant book, and I was really pleased to see this article which argues that it’s also become <a href=\"https://lithub.com/the-best-novel-about-21st-century-male-loneliness-was-written-in-1989/\">the definitive novel about 21st century male loneliness</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And I think it’s right: part of the impact of our relationships moving from primarily face to face to being mediated by the internet is, as Sherry Turkle put it, that we are <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9780465093656\">alone together</a>. In that sense, it mirrors the mental state of going climbing, which is a social activity done primarily in solitude. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. Ignorance of your (global) culture is not considered cool</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think of myself as pretty well-educated. But I didn’t understand the role that India played in essentially creating the numbering system which we all used – I, like most, thought it originated with Arab mathematicians. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But it didn’t, and <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781408864418\">the forthcoming book by William Dalrymple</a> about how India changed the world got ordered quickly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/sep/01/hidden-story-ancient-india-west-maths-astronomy-historians\">once I read this article</a>. And it is, as Dalrymple notes, ironic that the innovations in banking, accounting and business enabled by the Indian system of numbers when it reached the west did so much to create the financial muscle which allowed Europe to ultimately subjugate India. After all, it was “the East India Company – run from the City of London by merchants and accountants, with their ledgers and careful accounting – that ran amok and seized and subjugated a fragmented and divided India in what was probably the supreme act of corporate violence in history.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

This paragraph, in particular: “But another part is that despite achieving massive success, Apple continues to make decisions that put it at odds with the community that used to tirelessly advocate for them. They antagonize developers by demanding up to one-third of their revenue and block them from doing business the way they want. They make an ad (inadvertently or not) celebrating the destruction of every creative tool that isn’t sold by Apple. They antagonize regulators by exerting their power in ways that impact the entire market. They use a supposedly neutral notarization process to block apps from shipping on alternate app stores in the EU. Most recently they demand 30% of creators’ revenue on Patreon. No single action makes them the bad guy, but put together, they certainly aren’t acting like a company that is trying to make their enthusiast fans happy.

				"content_text": "<h1>1. Just because we killed you doesn't make us liable</h1>\n<p>Dr. Kanokporn Tangsuan died after eating a meal at a Disney resort. Her family claims this is down to an allergic reaction after the restaurant allegedly failed to label their food properly. So far, so tragic — but tragic in a completely normal way. What makes this incomprehensible, though, is that Disney's legal team have decided that <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/lawsuit/borders-on-the-absurd-dead-womans-estate-rejects-disneys-claim-that-widowers-disney-membership-means-wrongful-death-lawsuit-must-be-arbitrated/\">a clause in the Disney+ streaming service's ToS</a> — which one of the plaintiffs had trialled a few years ago — means the case can't be tried in a court. While this sounds extreme, terms of service are chock-full of this kind of stuff, all designed to create a parallel legal system that's easier for large companies to game to their advantage. Not content with having a legal system that's inherently rigged in their favour thanks to costs and their ability to lobby to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/16/california_ai_safety_bill/\">have laws they don't like watered down</a>, companies are trying to avoid <em>any</em> legal responsibility. Truly, we live in feudal times.</p>\n<h1>2. But wait, what's this coming over the horizon?</h1>\n<p>Finally — <em>finally</em> — though, big companies are getting held to some semblance of account. Last week Google found that just because you're acknowledged as the best product doesn't mean you can also pay <a href=\"https://apple.com\">potential competitors</a> to ensure they don't challenge you. <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/17/hack-the-planet/\">Cory Doctorow's talk at Defcon 32</a> outlines what's going on, and why regulation and law is the biggest sharpest tool in the box to ensure a competitive landscape in tech and elsewhere. Required reading.</p>\n<h1>3. You all know who Stanley Baldwin is, right?</h1>\n<p>Baldwin was the British prime minister who finally stood up to the press barons in the UK -- and won. That's a lesson today's leaders, including Keir Starmer, should take to heart. <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/ideas/law/67590/thierry-bretons-letter-to-x-may-be-the-eus-stanley-baldwin-moment\">This article</a> highlights European Commission Thierry Breton's <a href=\"https://x.com/ThierryBreton/status/1823033048109367549\">public letter to Elon Musk</a> as a similar moment. It is, of course, only part of Europe's ongoing campaign to make big tech companies actually follow the same laws as everyone else. You might agree or disagree with individual actions, but if you don't believe that companies should be subject to the law “without fear or favour” then you probably shouldn't keep reading this blog.</p>\n<h1>4. “Associated fees”</h1>\n<p>I genuinely try not to include yet more Apple-bashing every week, but — oh Tim! – they make it really hard for me. Take <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/developers-can-soon-offer-in-app-nfc-transactions-using-the-secure-element/\">the announcement this week</a> it would finally (I'm using that word a lot this week) open up the NFC features on iPhones to third parties globally, allowing them to create payment systems which don't have to go via Apple Pay. Yay! Except… “to incorporate this new solution in their iPhone apps, developers will need to enter into a commercial agreement with Apple, request the NFC and SE entitlement, <strong>and pay the associated fees</strong>”. What fees? Who knows — Apple isn't saying yet — but the idea that a developer can do anything at all on the iPhone without paying the company even more money seems to be one that Tim and the boys can't accept.</p>\n<h1>5. Double Cory</h1>\n<p>Another thing I try not to do is link to the same person in a week, but in addition to a great speech at Defcon, <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/08/15/private-law/\">Cory Doctorow gave Apple a well-deserved kicking</a> over everything that I seem to write about every week. And it relates back to the sad story of Dr Tangsuan, too. As Cory puts it: “Apple doesn't oppose regulation; Apple loves regulation, so long as they're the ones doing the regulating. They want to be able to shape and define the digital market, backed by the power of the state, but without any input from the state. In modern corporate orthodoxy, the state is an enforcer for corporate will.”</p>\n<h1>6. Who controls what you see on the web?</h1>\n<p>Another of Cory's concepts that I like is the idea of a web browser as user agent. It's a piece of software designed to show you the web in the way you want: with or without ads, text-only with all the crap giant images stripped out, or whatever. I was thinking about this when I read <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/google-ai-summaries-indexing/\">Nick Heer's article</a> on the way Google is taking increasing control over the way that search results are represented on its site. As I have written before, the AI answers which are now infesting results are not only hard for publisher will become the default click for most users — even if they are generally pretty bad results. Currently there are many ways to get rid of them, but I doubt those will last if Google gets its way.</p>\n<h1>7. Damn, I want one</h1>\n<p>Ars Technica has a long (of course) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/framework-laptop-13-reviewed-again-meteor-lake-meh-linux-upgrades-good/\">review of the latest Framework laptop</a>, and it makes me want one. I'm 99% sure that my next computer will be a Framework because I <em>adore</em> the concept of being able to easily upgrade everything on it (and reuse parts elsewhere). One impressive thing about the new model: compared to the original, you're getting roughly double the battery life. It's still not MacBook Air level, but it's close enough for most people.</p>\n<h1>8. The early history of CP/M</h1>\n<p>Annoyingly I didn't note down where I found this (if it's your site, please let me know) but this is <a href=\"http://www.retrotechnology.com/dri/CPM_history_kildall.txt\">an amazing article by Gary Kildall, who wrote CP/M, on its early history</a>, from a 1980 edition of Dr Dobbs.</p>\n<h1>9. The later years of Douglas Adams</h1>\n<p>Although Douglas Adams was <em>MacUser's</em> first inside-back cover columnist (and owner of the first Mac in the UK), and Michael Bywater was a regular columnist later on, I never realised the two were friends. Or, in fact, that Bywater was Adams' occasional ghostwriter when Douglas was finding it difficult to get motivated. <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2024/07/the-later-years-of-douglas-adams/\">Parts of this article</a> reference events I remember, particularly the launch of <em>Starship Titanic</em>, but there is a lot in it that I didn't know.</p>\n<h1>10. The NSA is refusing to release a historic video of Grace Hopper</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/07/the-nsa-has-a-long-lost-lecture-by-adm-grace-hopper.html\">Via Bruce Schneier</a>, the NSA has discovered in its archives a video of a talk by Grace Hopper on “Future Possibilities: Data, Hardware, Software, and People” — but, so far, is refusing to release it. The reason is that the recording is in a tape format which they can't easily watch as they no longer have a player capable of working with it. That in turn means that the NSA can't view it and redact it (as, legally, they probably have to if it's an internal document). Of course, they could borrow such a player from someone else, which the NSA seems reluctant to do. This kind of information archaeology always reminds me of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060805102033/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks\">Mark Pilgrim's post</a> from (crikey) 18 years ago: “I’m creating things now that I want to be able to read, hear, watch, search, and filter 50 years from now. Despite all their emphasis on content creators, Apple has made it clear that they do not share this goal. Openness is not a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060805102033/http://www.physics.brocku.ca/etc/cargo_cult_science.html\">cargo cult</a>. Some get it, some don’t. Apple doesn’t.”</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<h1>1. IBM 1956 = Google 2024 (and Apple, and Microsoft, and and and)</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/03/22/a-few-thoughts-on-the-apple-doj-antitrust-case-from-someone-who-isnt-riding-his-first-rodeo/\">As I've noted before</a>, you are likely to read an awful lot of bad punditry about Apple's cases with the EC/DOJ in the next few months/years. But you're likely to hear a lot of even <em>worse</em> punditry about the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-05/google-loses-doj-antitrust-suit-over-search?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyMjg4NzAxOSwiZXhwIjoxNzIzNDkxODE5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSFJESEdEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIxRUQxNUE1MkFFMTM0Q0RCQkI4OTlCRDQzMEMwRTJGMiJ9.AXKyb-b9oeRwjEUi9APCif1T511CVkXu-lf5ayIRoO8\">judgement in Google's case</a>. One thing to bear in mind whenever you read something is this: what is legally permissible when you're a smaller company can become illegal action when you're a monopoly. A “distribution agreement” that's OK when you're a scrappy upstart in a competitive market is likely to be exclusionary practice for a monopoly.</p>\n<h1>2. \"The Purpose of antitrust is to protect competition\"</h1>\n<p>Another great piece in The Verge was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24215684/doj-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-google-monopoly-verdict-win-decoder-podcast-interview\">the long interview with Jonathan Kanter</a>, assistant attorney general for antitrust at the DOJ. It's worth a read in its entirety, but probably the most important point is where Kanter talks about \"the restoration and validation of a core of element of antitrust — the purpose of antitrust is to protect competition and the competitive process.\" This is bringing the US view of antitrust both back to its pre-1980s roots and closer to that of the EU (which is <em>obsessed</em> with protecting competitive markets), and it bodes badly for big tech companies.</p>\n<h1>3. Acquisition by stealth</h1>\n<p>Interestingly, one of the questions that Kanter is asked but doesn't really answer is about Microsoft's deal which saw it gain 51% of OpenAI and a chunk of control over it without actually buying the company. These \"acquisitions by stealth\" are increasingly common, as big tech firms see them — wrongly — as a way of avoiding antitrust trouble. The latest such deal has seen Google “buy” Character.ai by hiring its team, licensing the tech and handing investors a cheque for $2.5bn. The company still exists — in theory — but <a href=\"https://www.wheresyoured.at/burst-damage/\">as Ed Zitron points out</a> \"without exclusive access to their models, and without an engineering team, the company is effectively dead.\" The problem for the likes of Google, as Kanter makes clear in his Verge interview, is that the DOJ is wise to the move. I wonder which big tech company will get hauled through court over this practice first.</p>\n<h1>4. Apple's increasingly Vista-like prompts</h1>\n<p>Since macOS Catalina, Apple has <em>loved</em> prodding you to check if you really wanted to do something. This is not a bad thing: Unix-based/like systems like macOS let users do many things which could endanger the security of the computer, and there are many people out there who make a living from fooling you into doing something you shouldn't. But, <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/08/apples-permissions-features-are-out-of-balance/\">as Jason Snell notes</a>, macOS Sequoia takes this a step further by making you confirm permissions over and over again — in some cases, every week. Jason says, \"at some point, the user must be in charge\" and this is an argument that I come back to a lot. There is a group of (very loud on the internet) people who want Apple to oversee their computers, “protecting” them from everything so they never have to learn to take any responsibility for themselves. I'm not one of those people, and I genuinely think most computer users don't fall into that camp either.</p>\n<h1>5. Weaponised litigation</h1>\n<p>Elon Musk is <a href=\"https://the-media-leader.com/weaponised-litigation-industry-stands-ground-against-x-following-garm-shutdown/\">suing an advertising group</a> because no one wants to put ads next to homophobic, transphobic, racist and far-right content. Nothing says “loser” like this level of entitlement.</p>\n<h1>6. Fees fees and more fees</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/08/apple-app-store-eu-link-out-changes/\">Does Apple really think that crap like this is going to fly</a>? As <a href=\"https://x.com/bzamayo/status/1821590971173281845\">Benjamin Mayo points out</a>, this means that, in theory, Apple could end up being entitled to fees from a service which is purchased on Android. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/08/apple-eu-new-fee-for-apps-that-link-out\">John Gruber is correct</a>, in saying \"what Apple wants is to continue making bank from every purchase on digital goods from an iOS app\". But Apple just isn't going to get that unless it starts playing the game with a little more wisdom and stops this kind of playground nonsense. Microsoft tried the same. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp._v._Commission\">How did that work out for them</a>?</p>\n<h1>7. But you know Apple earns its App Store money</h1>\n<p>There is currently <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/08/09/deluge-of-fake-mac-app-store-reviews/\">a deluge of fake reviews for Mac App Store products</a>. Maybe Apple is too busy attempting to weasel out of its legal responsibilities to proactively stop them?</p>\n<h1>8. On notarisation</h1>\n<p>If you want to know a huge amount about the way that notarisation of applications works on the Mac, by the way, <a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2024/08/10/gatekeeper-and-notarization-in-sequoia/\">Howard is your man</a>.</p>\n<h1>9. When Apple's line was a mess</h1>\n<p>Oh <a href=\"https://512pixels.net/2024/08/performa-month-the-dawn-of-performa-200-400-600-600cd/\">the Performa line</a>. A bit before Apple was in its “beleaguered” phase, it came up with the Performa brand for its “consumer” PCs. Performas weren't actually much different to the rest of the line, but they came with some consumer software. Occasionally Mac models got three versions, all identical apart from the badge. My second Mac, for example, was the LC475, which was called that name when sold to education, but was also the Performa 475 when sold to consumers, and the Quadra 605 when sold to business. What a mess that whole era was.</p>\n<h1>10. And speaking of retro</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/02/cpm_50th_anniversary/\">CP/M is fifty years old</a>.</p>\n",

This obvious bunk was swallowed and regurgitatd by the usual crowd of pundits who don’t believe big tech companies can be regulated, as well as a few who should have known better, but Paul did the work – and of course it turns out the EC did nothing of the sort. As Paul notes: “The EU didn’t force Microsoft to change Windows. It asked Microsoft to address the complaints it had raised, and this was only one of them.

				"content_text": "<h1>1. Oh come on, Apple</h1>\n<p>Back when Apple changed its app guidelines to permit emulators and HTML 5-based mini games it looked like the dawning of just a little bit of light in Cupertino. Completely coincidentally these changes were made just before the DOJ case at which this kind of restriction was central. And weirdly, it looks like Apple is now walking those changes back -- without, of course, putting that in writing.</p>\n<p>When Sticky was rejected on the basis of Rule 4.7, the company appealed. <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40991796\">Cue a call with someone from Apple</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In our case, after the appeal, we were called up by someone from Apple who started the call saying they did not consent to it being recorded (how’s that for inspiring trust?), who walked-back what they had said about HTML5 (and of course they did not put that in writing in the message they sent afterwards), but then came up with a couple of brand-new reasons for keeping our update off the store: claiming that we had changed the app concept… because our app was different some 4 years ago and hundreds of updates ago when it started! And including mentioning rule 4.7 regarding emulators… which we are not and do not claim to be!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>2. It's all about the user experience</h1>\n<p>Unless you have an ad blocker in place you will be very familiar with the contextual advertising from Taboola. Those blocks at the bottom of web pages listing amazing hair loss treatments and cheap junk? That's Taboola. Now you can argue that those ads are junk because people click on them (and there's something to that), but junk they are.</p>\n<p>They do, though, make publishers a lot of money -- and now Apple wants a chunk of that money, and has struck a deal with Taboola to become an advertising partner on Apple News. <a href=\"https://om.co/2024/07/16/taboola-apple-news-no-thanks/\">Om Malik has had enough</a>. I'm not one to pull the \"this would never have happened in Steve's day\" card, but really, Jobs had taste: there's zero chance he would have got into bed with Taboola for a few billion dollars.</p>\n<h1>3. The objects of our life</h1>\n<p>And if you don't believe, that, I recommend <a href=\"https://stevejobsarchive.com/exhibits/objects-of-our-life\">watching the video that's just been found and released by the Steve Jobs Archive</a>. It's Steve’s talk at the 1983 International Design Conference in Aspen, and it's a great watch. For all his faults, the man had taste.</p>\n<h1>4. Eazel come, Eazel go</h1>\n<p>There was a point towards the end of the 90s when I began to believe that desktop Linux really was the future. Yes, I know. But one of the things which persuaded me was Eazel, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2000/02/24/eazel/\">a startup which included legendary Apple people like Andy Hertzfeld, Mick Boich and Susan Kare</a>, who were aiming to create a user interface for Linux which did not suck. Eazel didn't last, but its product did: if you use GNOME today, you're looking at something which started life as Eazel's Nautilus file manager. I very much wish it still had Susan's icons in it. <a href=\"https://www.storiesofapple.net/working-at-eazel-an-interview-with-gene-ragan.html\">Apple rehired a bunch of Eazel employees</a>, so if you're using macOS, you are also seeing something with Eazel DNA.</p>\n<h1>5. Return to office is a failure</h1>\n<p>Of course, it depends on what kind of work you do, but for millions of office workers around the world the one good outcome of the pandemic has been more working from home. Home working has many advantages, particularly for mid-career workers (less so for younger ones) but finally <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/articles/the-data-is-in-return-to-office-mandates-aren-t-worth-the-talent-risks\">Gartner has come out and done some really interesting and in-depth research</a>. High performing employees, in particular, hate return to office mandates because they prize flexibility and see them as a sign of distrust by managers. I've said it before and I'll say it again: if you can't manage remote workers, that's your problem not theirs.</p>\n<h1>6. Google is mind-bogglingly bad</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://om.co/2024/07/19/google-is-mind-bogglingly-bad/\">So says Om</a>, and I have to agree: in terms of product design, Google has got a lot worse over the last few years.</p>\n<h1>7. \"Privacy preserving\" Lololollol</h1>\n<p>There's a bit of a brouhaha because <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/07/18/safari-private-click-measurement-and-firefox-privacy-preserving-attribution/\">both Firefox and Safari have added a default-on \"privacy preserving ad tracking\" feature</a>, which anonymously measures ad clicks at the browser level and passes that on to advertising companies. It's not a big deal for me -- I block ads at the DNS level, so don't see them to click on them -- but it's made a lot of people unhappy.</p>\n<h1>8. Calling for civil war is, apparently \"controversial\"</h1>\n<p>And now for some awful people. I had never heard of this guy <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2024/07/19/messari-ryan-selkis-donald-trump-political-controversy-tweets\">before he started shooting his mouth off</a>, but apparently he's some kind of crypto big cheese, which already tells me a lot. But what made me laugh is the headline, which refers to his comments as \"controversial\". Apparently, calling for civil war, calling for anyone not voting for Trump to \"die in a fire\", alluding positively to a conspiracy theory that the guy who shot Trump was related to Elizabeth Warren… these things are all \"controversial\". Not \"violent\", \"traitorous\", \"racist\"… oh no, those words are going too far!</p>\n<h1>9. This is where it was always going</h1>\n<p>Elon Musk has decided that he owns Twitter, so <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-modifies-twitter-code-donald-trump\">he can use it for whatever he wants</a>. An object lesson why platforms should not be owned by billionaires.</p>\n<h1>10. Return of the underdogs</h1>\n<p>One thing Apple does extremely well is advertising, and my favourite ads of the last few years have been the ones that focus on <em>The Underdogs</em> - I find them incredibly funny and charming, and a bit of light relief from all the travails of tech. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbYckRAt5os\">Enjoy</a>.</p>\n",

They’re also the ones who argue loudest that blocking is evil, and you’ll be stuck in a filter bubble or an echo chamber if you deprive yourself of their sparkling wit. You should block these guys faster than anyone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/ianbetteridge.com/post/3krvcuvsec327\">recently had an encounter with one of these guys</a> – and they are always guys – myself. They see you blocking them as some kind of cowardice, and they see tools which let you control your own information environment (filters) as a refusal to engage with whatever views they believe to be correct and important.</p>\n<p>Bluesky's moderation service is optional – <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/moderation.bsky.app\">you can turn it off</a>, and be exposed all the hate speech you want. But people like Dorsey and my random guy don't want you to be able to block or filter views you disagree with. What they want is a form of coercive control, the ability to override what you desire to make it what they think is good for you. Think Elon Musk, putting himself into every single timeline and <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/sorry-you-wont-be-able-to-block-elon-musk-or-anyone-else-on-x-184331733.html?guccounter=1\">proposing to make people (i.e. him) unblockable</a>.</p>\n<p>Filtering is another kind of user agent, a representation of <strong>my</strong> control over what I want to see and do online, <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/07/treacherous-computing/\">and that's a good thing</a>. Similarly, genuinely federated services like Mastodon (<a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds\">but not Bluesky, yet</a>) allow you to devolve moderation to a trusted administrator (for your instance) <em>and</em> add your own personal blocks and filters too. In this way, Mastodon allows the creation of genuine communities, which share values and also decide to what degree they want to connect to the rest of the world. They can be as isolated or federated as they wish.</p>\n",

Couldn’t happen to a nicer billionaire</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What’s interesting about the <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-charges-musks-x-for-letting-disinfo-run-wild/\">European Commission’s charges against Twitter</a> (which I refuse to call X because it’s a stupid name) is the focus on the blue checks' policy. Everyone knew this was a bad idea driven solely by Musk’s hatred of anyone more fascinating than him. The chickens have well and truly come home to roost – at a cost of up to 6% of the company’s global revenue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. The end of the cheap money era</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re a football fan, you might know the name Clearlake Capital for its ownership of Chelsea – and the fact that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/68805247\">it’s spent getting on for £1bn on players</a>. All that money has to come from somewhere and like all private equity companies, Clearlake has piled a lot of debt on to its companies. The era of cheap money is over, so <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-09/chelsea-fc-owner-clearlake-faces-investor-doubts-over-debt-issues?srnd=homepage-uk\">it’s finding it harder to follow the same model</a>.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. The toxic nature of the OpenAI board seat</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not that long ago, Microsoft was proudly talking about its “observer” seat on the OpenAI board. Now it’s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-10/microsoft-quits-openai-board-after-antitrust-scrutiny-grows?srnd=homepage-uk\">decided it’s “no longer necessary”</a>. I’m sure it’s a complete coincidence that both the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/cdb1ab92-9148-47c4-add1-a079a7652ddb\">EU</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3e8acee-536a-47c2-9322-464d14c51053\">US authorities</a> have been looking at the relationship between the two companies with interest. The tech pundits will be along to tell us how this is stifling innovation or some such real soon now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. And speaking of private equity</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Charlie Mullins, who sold Pimlico Plumbers to a private equity company, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-05-30/kkr-is-buying-family-owned-plumbers-like-uk-s-pimlico-whose-founder-has-regrets?srnd=homepage-uk\">now has regrets</a>. I’m not surprised: the private equity model is based on “efficiencies”, which can be translated as “worse services”, and Pimlico became successful because of its customer service. Of course, it doesn’t matter to the PE companies: they can always flip the business to some other sucker further down the line, after they have drained it through special dividends.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Little tech (not to be confused with small tech)</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Techno-optimism is so last week. Now, <a href=\"https://www.techpolicy.press/the-little-tech-agenda-is-just-selfserving-nonsense/\">the odious Andreessen is promoting the idea of “little tech”</a> which, of course, means the kind of startups that A16Z invests in. And of course, there’s no need for those companies to actually grow: the aim is to flip them to one of the big tech firms before the need to make a profit actually arrives. I’m actually glad that the thing which some smart analysts once told me didn’t happen – VC companies investing in businesses solely to flip them – is now a part of the business they’re happy to admit is the goal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. AI slop</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Christina Warren noticed something odd: her byline was appearing against articles which she hadn’t written. It turns out that TUAW, which she used to write for a good decade and a bit ago, <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/tuaw-zombie/\">had been acquired by the kind of company which churns out AI-generated crap content</a>, and they had been using the bylines of people who used to work there. Related: I have no idea who owns some of the domains I used to work on, including macuser.co.uk, which doesn’t appear to have moved to Future alongside the old print product.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Piracy is back, baby</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wendy Grossman – who has been writing a weekly column on the internet for longer than some of you have been alive – has written an excellent piece on <a href=\"https://netwars.pelicancrossing.net/2024/07/12/the-return-of-piracy/\">the second coming of internet piracy</a>. As Wendy notes, the emergence of piracy as a more mainstream activity comes at the same moment that streaming services have started to get pricier and worse. The removal of decades of Comedy Central clips is teaching a new generation that you can’t trust content will remain online. There is a reason I have a couple of 4Tb drives attached to a local machine, kids.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. RIP Bruce</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I missed that <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/07/05/bruce-bastian-rip/\">Bruce Bastien had died</a>. Before Microsoft used tying, bundling and other illegal behaviour to destroy all its competitors in the 1990s, I used WordPerfect rather than Word, and it still offers features which you can’t get anywhere else. <a href=\"https://www.wordperfect.com/en/\">Technically, it still exists</a>, but I wouldn’t recommend it. Related: I’m amazed to find you can still buy Quattro Pro too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Switching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/07/10/transfer-from-google-photos-to-icloud-photos/\">You can now easily transfer your images from iCloud to Google Photos</a>. Why would you want to do that? Because if you have many images stored only in Apple’s cloud, downloading them all and then exporting using the Photos app is a horrible experience. Unless you like watching Photos’ memory usage balloon to more than 64Gb and then take down your whole system, of course. Google Photos, on the other hand, lets you download them all from the browser thanks to Google Takeout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. No politics allowed</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When big tech platforms talk about not allowing political speech, what they almost always mean is “no political speech we don’t like”. And <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/lgbt-and-marginalized-voices-are-not-welcome-on-threads/\">when Meta says it about Threads</a>, what it means is “no marginalised people here, please.” Kudos to MacStories for publishing this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<h1>1. I'm shocked, shocked I tell you</h1>\n<p>Surprise! The use of energy-intensive AI to make stupid graphics that look instantly like AI and write words that it would take you five minutes to right have pushed <a href=\"https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/07/04/google-and-microsoft-are-getting-dirtier-they-cant-help-it-its-ai/\">Microsoft's greenhouse gas emissions up by 30% since 2020 and Google's up 48% since 2019</a>. But it's OK, Google's energy usage is only 0.1% of the entire planet's, it's not like it's much… there's more on this in <a href=\"https://disconnect.blog/generative-ai-is-a-climate-disaster/\">Paris Marx's article</a>, which is a good read too.</p>\n<h1>2. Destructive investment</h1>\n<p>Related to this of course is the entire system of investment, which focuses — at least in the US — on the primacy of shareholder interests over those of the country. This system has led directly to a lot of terrible outcomes, from Apple's “growth at all costs” approach to abusing its power in the market through to, well, Elon Musk. The same dynamic is gradually seeing many of our most valuable institutions fall into the hands of private equity companies, a group for whom the phrase “vulture capitalism” was virtually invented. And much of this delusional behaviour is, unfortunately, driven by <a href=\"https://buttondown.email/apperceptive/archive/destructive-investing-and-the-siren-song-of/\">myths about early tech companies</a>, from the startup-in-garage to the founders-as-heroes. I have to confess that I, too, once believed in these myths. I no longer do.</p>\n<h1>3. When Apple says protecting users, it means protecting profits</h1>\n<p>A single app store and an operating system which doesn't let you install the apps <em>you</em> choose is a single point for any government to control your experience. That's one of the reasons why battles to prevent Apple and others having a monopoly on software installation is important. Apple's desire to “own” software distribution is not about protecting users: it's about protecting profits. Case in point: the company has bowed to pressure from the Russian government and <a href=\"https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2024/07/04/apple-bows-to-kremlin-pressure-to-remove-leading-vpns-from-russian-appstore-en-news\">removed a number of VPNs, which allow Russians to bypass state censorship, from the App Store</a>. If Apple allowed sideloading, which it easily could, this would not be a big deal. But it would rather adopt the “principle” that users aren't allowed to install software from anywhere they want rather than oppose state surveillance.</p>\n<h1>4.Apple “crippled watchOS to lock out competitors”</h1>\n<p>When Apple changed its heart monitoring APIs in watchOS 5, it's claimed, it did so to ensure third-party competitors <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/28/apple_watch_alivecor/\">didn't get access to the same data its own apps had</a>. I don't know if this is true, but even if it's not, it's another example of why platform owners like Apple need to be made to ensure a level playing field if innovation is to thrive.</p>\n<h1>5.Apple (Computer) Says no</h1>\n<p>Want to run DOS on your iPhone or iPad? <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/06/14/utm-blocked-outside-app-store-via-notarization/\">Apple says you can't</a>. Why not? Because Apple says so. Just because you paid Apple £1000 for your iPhone doesn't mean you get to install things you want. It's not like you own it or anything. What makes this even worse is that notarisation <em>should</em> be a system which is used solely to stop malware. In practice, Apple is simply using it to enforce its app store rules outside the app store — which discredits the whole purpose of notarisation.</p>\n<h1>6.Nerd History heaven</h1>\n<p>How well I remember the process of juggling INITs and CDEVs. <a href=\"https://eclecticlight.co/2024/06/29/a-short-history-of-mac-os-extensions/\">As always, Howard has the details</a>.</p>\n<h1>7. Meanwhile, In Microsoft land</h1>\n<p>Now if you're thinking about maybe ditching your Apple products and exchanging them for one of those fancy new Copilot + PCs, you might want to reconsider. Microsoft is going through one of its periodic seasons of hand-wringing about security, while, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/28/windows_insecure_by_design/\">adding in insecure features by design</a>. Everything that Microsoft is currently doing to Windows is aiming towards a single goal: to make sure you can't use Windows without connecting to a Microsoft account, and ensuring it has access to your data. Case in point: the New Outlook, which the company has been prodding users towards for a while. Unlike the old bundled Mail app, which used IMAP or POP, new Outlook only talks to Microsoft's servers: to use it with a non-Microsoft account you have to give Microsoft <a href=\"https://mailbox.org/en/post/warning-new-outlook-sends-passwords-mails-and-other-data-to-microsoft\">access to all your third-party email</a>. Oh, and <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/microsoft-wont-let-you-use-the-new-outlook-app-for-windows-unless-you-have-installed-edge-on-your-pc\">don't think you can use it without also having Edge installed</a>. Not doubt, if questioned, it would claim this is all for “security” or “the benefit of users”. A plague on all their houses.</p>\n<h1>8.Proton Changes</h1>\n<p>Proton, everyone's favourite bunch of Swiss-based nerds, <a href=\"https://proton.me/blog/proton-non-profit-foundation\">is going to move towards a non-profit structure</a>. This is a good thing. Owned by a Swiss non-profit foundation, the company can't be as easily taken over — and the foundation itself is legally obligated to act in a way which supports its original mission.</p>\n<h1>9. Docs, docs and more docs</h1>\n<p>And speaking of Proton, they launched <a href=\"https://proton.me/blog/docs-proton-drive\">their own collaborative cloud-based document system</a>. It seems like a pretty private system: everything is encrypted end-to-end, and no data is collected that isn't necessary to make the thing work.</p>\n<h1>10.Sixteen Kids and a hitman</h1>\n<p>Away from the world of technology for the last couple of pieces. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/christopher-pence-corderos-fbi-dark-web-hit-man.html\">This story</a> of an evangelical man who went on to the dark net to hire a hitman to have the biological parents of his adopted children murdered is quite the thing.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<h1>1. Oh Perplexity, why must you test me so?</h1>\n<p>I have been a big proponent of Perplexity for a while, mostly because I found it incredibly useful as a research tool. Turns out the reason it was useful as a research tool was it was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187405/perplexity-ai-twitter-lie-plagiarism\">scraping a load of data that it shouldn’t, pretending to be academic researchers to get access to Twitter, and more</a>. Suffice to say, I no longer recommend it. But more than that: organisations which engage in this kind of perfidious conduct should be actively shunned.</p>\n<h1>2. The cows are lying down</h1>\n<p>And speaking of AI, 404 Media decided to conduct an experiment: how much would it cost to basically clone their site using LLMs and off-the shelf tools? The answer: <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/i-paid-365-63-to-replace-404-media-with-ai/\">$365.63</a>. And they wouldn’t have to employ any of those pesky journalists to do it.</p>\n<h1>3.  Better by you…</h1>\n<p>What was the internet like 20 years ago? Without coming across like an old git, the answer is just “<a href=\"https://cybercultural.com/p/internet-2004/\">better</a>”. Like Richard, I started blogging using Radio Userland, a long-forgotten application developed by Dave Winer. Like everything Winer makes, it was really an outliner (when I first worked at Apple in 1989, we used MORE for presentations – it was also a Winer product, and also really an outliner). It was also local: it generated all the HTML for your blog on your Mac and then uploaded the changed files. I still there there’s something in that approach.</p>\n<h1>4. Are you though? Are you really?</h1>\n<p>Ever wondered what it’s like being a low-ranking professional tennis player? No, I hadn’t either — but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jun/27/the-loneliness-of-the-low-ranking-tennis-player\">this great piece in The Guardian</a> had me laughing, then shaking my head, then laughing again. My favourite line: ““I am going to fight my natural hand-to-eye coordination, no matter how bad it is, I am going to hit all of these motherfucking balls until I develop a shot. I am going to do this for months and months and months: I am not going to let these rich fucks beat me.”</p>\n<h1>5.  Breakin’ the law, breakin’ the law</h1>\n<p>Confession time: whenever I buy an ebook which is encumbered with DRM, I crack it and save a local copy. I don’t give it away, loan it, upload it anywhere — but I don’t trust companies to keep their unspoken promise that I will always be able to access that book. Why don’t I trust them to? <a href=\"https://memex.craphound.com/2019/06/28/microsoft-is-about-to-shut-off-its-ebook-drm-servers-the-books-will-stop-working/\">Here’s why</a>. And yes, I did have books which used this DRM system.</p>\n<h1>6. And speaking of Microsoft DRM systems</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://borncity.com/win/2024/06/26/microsoft-employee-accidentally-publishes-playready-code/\">Oops</a>. Repeat after me: DRM is pointless.</p>\n<h1>7. Creative destruction</h1>\n<p>Look, in the great long list of terrible things that the Tories have spent fourteen years doing to Britain, the effective <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/article/2024/jun/30/dreams-and-jobs-slowly-fade-away-as-bristol-bears-brunt-of-arts-cuts\">destruction of much of the support for the arts</a> that had been built up for decades may not seem like the worst. But in terms of the breadth of people it affects, it’s probably the broadest. Obviously, underfunding organisations and forcing them to spend more time chasing money than supporting creative work is bad. But they have also <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-68590928\">hammered funding for adult education cources which aren’t “vocational”</a>, which means that drawing, painting and other creative practice classes are not being cut – something disproportionately affects older people. Capitalism hates creativity.</p>\n<h1>8. PRs: please don’t do this</h1>\n<p>I don’t get that many unsolicited press releases these days (don’t think of this as a request) and I doubt that even during the Journalism Peak of my career I got as many as Jay Rayner, but I completely sympathise with his public letter asking that PRs do <a href=\"https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/jay-rayner-pr-industry-emails/\">at least the minimum amount of research before sending him stuff</a>.</p>\n<h1>9. The grumpiest man from Wales is back</h1>\n<p>God I love John Cale. Way back in the first years of this century I was lucky enough to see him do readings from his book <em>What’s Welsh for Zen?</em> at Komedia in Brighton, and he almost bit the head off an audience member who was trying to video him. <a href=\"https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/if-its-not-grueling-its-not-worth-it-john-cale-in-conversation-with-michael-sheen\">In the twenty four years since he’s just got grumpier</a> and he remains a vital creative force. I adore him.</p>\n<h1>10. The best reason not to use AI</h1>\n<p>We really do not need <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-ai-data-centers-power-grids/?ai=eyJpc1N1YnNjcmliZWQiOnRydWUsImFydGljbGVSZWFkIjpmYWxzZSwiYXJ0aWNsZUNvdW50IjowLCJ3YWxsSGVpZ2h0IjoxfQ==\">another global power crisis</a> while we’re trying to stop the planet burning.</p>\n",

Microsoft said it will vigorously defend the freedom of every American company to innovate and improve its products, a principle that lies at the heart of this case. Microsoft said today’s action by the Government will set a harmful precedent in which government intervention into a healthy, competitive and innovative industry will adversely impact consumers and a U.S. company’s ability to improve its products. The company said it appears that the lawsuit is more in the interest of a single Microsoft competitor than in the interest of American consumers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oddly enough, when Microsoft lost its cases' innovation didn't end.

				"content_text": "<p>Another day, another spat between Apple and the EU.</p>\n<p>I'm not going to focus on the ridiculous idea that the DMA Is too vague, or that someone EU law is about \"the spirit of the law\" rather than its letter. You have to know nothing about EU law – or, in fact, how <em>any</em> law works – to believe that. Neither am I going to address the nonsensical thought that the EU is making design decisions: if you believe that regulation is \"making design decisions\" then both Washington and Brussels have been making design decisions in the car industry for decades.</p>\n<p>Nor am I going to say much about the hysterical \"EU IS BEING JUDGE JURY AND EXECUTIONER!!!\" piffle. Just go read Article 45 of the DMA. It won't take you long, and you can read it in many languages.</p>\n<p>What I will say, though, is that the idea that companies can't know if a feature is compliant before they release it – an idea that's well-beloved of quite a few pundits – is at best ignorant and at worst downright deception. Article 8(3) of the DMA lays out how companies can engage with the Commission to \"determine whether the measures that that gatekeeper intends to implement or has implemented to ensure compliance with Articles 6 and 7 are effective in achieving the objective of the relevant obligation in the specific circumstances of the gatekeeper.\"</p>\n<p>In other words, companies can engage with the EU <em>before something is released</em> to work out ways to stay within the DMA. The idea that it's just a crap shoot and WHO KNOWS WHAT THOSE CRAZY EUROS WILL WANT is just silly.</p>\n<p>And maybe, in fact, that's what Apple is doing behind the scenes – in which case, it should just cut the crap and say it. Part of the mystery about this is we actually already knew some of it. Apple had already announced it wouldn't be released Apple Intelligence except in US English before the end of the year. That means, of course, EU countries weren't going to get it for a while anyway.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-dma-financial-times\">the non-explanation explanation which Apple provider to John Gruber</a>, it said this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Specifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security. We are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This of course explains nothing, except stringing together “concern” with “privacy”, making ti sound like the big bad EU is going to force Apple to compromise the privacy of its users. Given the EU's long history of protecting the privacy of its citizens from US tech companies determined to operate in a wild west of personal data, this seems unlikely. And given <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/04/10/new-apple-iphone-privacy-warning-issued-by-researchers/\">Apple's own track record of ensuring users can't withhold their own data from Apple</a> when it's beneficial to the company, I know who is on the side of user privacy here.</p>\n<p>Apple is happy <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/technology/apple-china-censorship-data.html\">to cave in to even the most repressive regimes</a> and forget about user privacy when it's beneficial to its bottom line. On the other hand, when user privacy conflicts with Apple's profits, it will go to the mat to defend its right to do what the hell it wants. That's why <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/apple-iphone-analytics-tracking-even-when-off-app-store-1849757558\">even if you tick the box marked \"disable sharing of analytics\", your iPhone will continue sharing analytics with Apple</a>.</p>\n<p>I really don't understand what Apple's game is here. Getting into a pissing match with a multinational block that sees the sanctity of free markets as its reason for existence and markets locked down by companies as an existential threat is not going to end well for any company.</p>\n<p>Does it think it's going to get the DMA overturned? That a bit of magic PR will encourage a consumer rebellion of iPhone lovers riding to its rescue? I suspect it is still labouring under the impression that it's still considered “the misfits, the crazy ones”, the people who are on the side of consumers. A brand so beloved that even the EU can't touch it.</p>\n<p>If so, I think it's become disconnected from reality. We saw with <a href=\"https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/why-apple-ipad-ad-controversy-backlash-1236017855/\">the controversy over the \"crush\" ad</a> that people are now less likely to give it the benefit of the doubt, less likely to see it as the plucky underdog on the side of creative people.</p>\n<p>For all its focus on privacy – <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56928626\">and its genuine victories</a> – Apple is no longer trusted in the way it was. It's begun to be considered just another big tech company, one that's prepared to throw its toys out of the pram if it doesn't get its way. When a company's value is in the trillions, it's very hard to credibly say you're on the side of ordinary people.</p>\n",

Employees to Dell: “you first”</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everyone enjoys seeing a few chickens coming home to roost, and especially when the chickens are landing on the roof of a huge corporate entity and crapping all over its well-manicured rooftop executive garden. The latest to find out the hard way is Dell, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/nearly-half-of-dells-workforce-refused-to-return-to-the-office/\">ordered its employees to make a choice</a>: become “hybrid” workers travelling to an office 39 times a year (monitored of course) to spend their time on Zoom calls from an empty office, or be “remote” workers. Oh, and if you’re remote, you’re not allowed to get promoted or apply for another role in the company, ever.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No doubt the conversation in the executive suite was about how remote workers weren’t “team players” and so weren’t the kind of people who “deserved” promotion, no matter how well they actually do their job. But it’s turned out that if you choose to wield the stick rather than the carrot, people don’t respond too well: in fact, nearly 50% of employees have chosen collectively to shrug their shoulders and stay at home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s bad enough now, but it’s also <em>really</em> going to choke Dell as a business in the future. Retention is always an issue, and the retention of employees who have no prospects in a company is an almost impossible task. Any competent leader at Dell will be spending a lot of their time in the next year recruiting, while good employees go elsewhere to further their career in remote roles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And failing to retain costs money: way back in my early career, a slightly drunk finance director told me that when you accounted for the time of managers recruiting, the effort to find someone good, and short-term costs of backfilling vacant roles, you were basically burning about £2000 every time you recruited a replacement. The cost to Dell of increasing employee churn, with around 120,000 employees, is a lot: if this move adds another 5% to its churn rate, it runs into hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And for what?

Cory was right: DRM doesn’t work, and it never has. But the tech companies have managed to use its spiritual successors likes parts pairing and app stores, enabled by exploiting the intersection between bad law and technology, to do things which would have sounded <em>wild</em> to them in 2004.

You shouldn’t have to master how to use a search engine (or the frankly shitty experience that most SEO-led pages now deliver) to find what you want. And where you don’t quite know exactly what you want – such as when you’re buying a product – having a conversation with something that knows about products is a better way to do it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But oh: it turns out that Perplexity not only just makes stuff up, it has been <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/\">scraping data it</a> shouldn’t have and trying to cover its tracks.

It started with pizza, but, of course, had the stink of “disruption” about it, the kind of smell that always ends up spreading to a thousand other areas. It turned out, of course, that its magic robot roving ovens made pizza that was just bad – so they ended up having <em>stationary</em> “mobile” ovens and using human delivery drivers to actually take the product to the customer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In other words, VC’s decided that a company of pizza vans was worth $2.25 <em>billion.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Masters of the universe, my ass.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.

But it’s worth remembering that the canonical use of “feature not product” was Steve Jobs telling this to Dropbox. And somehow, Dropbox is not only still around, it’s a good product – and still better than anything Apple has developed. What Apple has done is great: but in terms of the future, general purpose intelligence will probably win out for many tasks.

				"content_text": "<h1>1. Looks like a publisher, is actually an AI content farm</h1>\n<p>I'm still hearing about publishers who think the answer to their prayers is replacing human writers with large language models. But the real issue, and the one that actually puts the whole publishing model at risk, is the ability of companies to just start up massive \"news\" websites, win for a few months before Google works out they are are crap, rinse and repeat. BNN was an example o this. I saw it <strong>a lot</strong> for a while, but then it vanished. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/bnn-breaking-ai-generated-news.html\">Here's the story</a>.</p>\n<h1>2. Publishers doing the right thing</h1>\n<p>Over here, <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/06/06/stolen-money-not-content/\">a group of publishers are suing Google for rigging the ad market</a>. I don't know, yet, which publishers, but my gut feeling would be it's mostly small ones as larger ones tend not to want to antagonise Google. This is of course a better approach than anything which relies on copyright, news taxes and so on, because it's simply true: Google and Facebook <strong>have</strong>, between them, stitched up the ad market.</p>\n<h1>3. Alexa, why does my toothbrush not work?</h1>\n<p>Things which rely on a connection to the internet to work are always vulnerable to simply being switched off by the people who made the product, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/oral-b-bricks-ability-to-set-up-alexa-on-230-smart-toothbrush/?utm_source=bluesky&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev&amp;utm_social-type=owned\">there's no better illustration of this than Oral-B \"smart\" toothbrush</a>. Part of me thinks that if you bought a toothbrush you could talk to you take a little bit of the blame, but I have also been caught by products which promised to have functionality which later disappeared. So I can't blame you too much if you bought a toothbrush expecting to be able to, erm, use it to manage your smart home.</p>\n<h1>4. Garry Tan promotes antisemitism</h1>\n<p>You might not know about Garry Tan yet, but you're likely to hear more about him. He's one of those venture capitalist vultures who seem to believe that having a lot of money makes them smart, but of course he's as dumb as the next arrogant bozo. He's so dumb, in fact, that he has taken to <a href=\"https://www.thenerdreich.com/y-combinator-ceo-garry-tan-soros-conspiracy/\">promoting antisemitic conspiracy theories aimed at George Soros</a>. Well, he's either dumb or just a racist. Which is it Garry?</p>\n<h1>5. Was Jack Dorsey always this awful? Reader, I am adding to this headline purely to avoid my own law, because yes, yes he was</h1>\n<p>Dorsey <a href=\"https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2024/05/10/jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralised-social-networks-and-the-very-common-crowd/\">doesn't like plebs</a>, doesn't want to take any responsibility for anything and has a shitty beard. That's all.</p>\n<h1>6. The Tories hate the young, but luckily the young hate the Tories</h1>\n<p>It's entirely predictable that the Tory manifesto will be full of regressive nonsense, but what they have managed to do in recent elections is dangle just enough carrots towards young people to make them, at least, not bother to vote Labour. Usually this involved some magic incantation involving the word \"aspiration\". <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2024/06/unbearable-predictability-tories-war-on-young-people-pensions-national-service\">Not so now!</a> Showing once again that Sunak has no political instincts at all, he has instead adopted a \"fuck you young people\" approach which is likely to get people voting against him, while adding nothing significant to his popularity amongst older voters. Stupidity, he is it.</p>\n<h1>7. Things I did not realise about my home town</h1>\n<p>It basically was the place <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/article/2024/jun/03/dracula-centenary-derby-grand-theatre-bram-stoker\">the modern version of Dracula first made his appearance</a>. Go, Derby!</p>\n<h1>8. Speaking of the undead</h1>\n<p>Tim Montgomerie, editor of Conservative Home, <a href=\"https://archive.is/OkjYB\">expects to see a poll which has Reform ahead of the Tories</a>. I wouldn't be surprised either, and it will probably mean the Tories lurch even more to the right. But: they should also remember that they are so far behind in most polls that even adding every single Reform voter to their tally would still see them lose, comfortably. And it would probably alienate what few more moderate Tories they have left.</p>\n<h1>9.  Now that's the right way to do AI</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.is/OkjYB\">Opt-in</a>. Not <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/03/windows_11_recall_on_default/\">opt-out</a>.</p>\n<h1>10.  At last</h1>\n<p>On one hand, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/apple-to-debut-passwords-app-in-challenge-to-1password-lastpass\">Apple actually building a proper password management app</a> is a good thing. The password keychain functions are a little bit buried at the moment, which discourages people from using them -- and using a password manager is a great way to Do Better Secures. But... Apple's features can be a bit of a roach motel: you can get in, but you'll never get out again. So far, that hasn't been true of passwords, but let's hope no bright spark in Cupertino thinks that now is the time.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>First of all, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->how the hell is it June already?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Is it just me? Is time passing at a ludicrously fast pace?</p>\n<p>OK, maybe it is just me.</p>\n<p>This week was, in work terms, truncated: A bank holiday plus a day off on Thursday made the week feel even shorter than normal. Since Thursday I have been up in Suffolk for a little mini-gathering of the clan, seeing my niece, her husband, and their two lovely children – the children for the first time ever. They all live over in Adelaide, where my brother and his wife settled over thirty years ago. An outpost of the Betteridge’s, established.</p>\n<p>Because I’m quite a bit younger than my siblings being a great-uncle has come pretty early. I’m less than 20 years older than my youngest niece, which means we share quite a few cultural references, probably more than my siblings in some ways. And my niece’s lovely husband (who once managed to absolutely charm my mother, which gives him bonus points) is a wonderful, lovely guy, too.</p>\n<p>Spending time away from home is good, but I’m less enamoured of living out of a rucksack than perhaps I would have been twenty years ago. I love being away, but the prospect of being at home in my own bed is what makes travelling special. The journey may indeed be the reward, but being able to soak in my own bath for a couple of hours is also part of the journey, in a way.</p>\n<p>This week I have been reading <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Beyond the light horizon<!-- raw HTML omitted --> by Ken Macleod, the third in a series which I have quite enjoyed. It’s a nice near-future romp which features submarines which are actually spaceships, a mysterious alien intelligence, and a European Union that’s developed into a more communistic union – and which works better. Thank you Ken for painting a picture of a near future that’s not totally wrecked. I enjoyed the first volume a lot, thought the second lagged a little (as second volumes often do) and am enjoying the third one a lot more so far.</p>\n<p>This week I also bought a new iPad, the 11in iPad Pro with the spangly new M4 chip in it. As a bit of background, I actually had two iPads: an M1 12.9in, and a recent iPad mini. Since I bought the MacBook Air M2, the 12.9 – which was intended to be my travelling machine – has hardly had much use. The 11in iPad Pro is intended to replace both, and be the device I take on trips and while commuting.</p>\n<p>This trip to Suffolk was its first journey, and it’s done really well. The new keyboard is a delight to type on. While I didn’t mind the previous Magic Keyboard, this is a far better feel and more akin to the excellent MacBook Air keyboard.

				"content_text": "First of all, <strong>how the hell is it June already?</strong> Is it just me? Is time passing at a ludicrously fast pace?\n\nOK, maybe it is just me.\n\nThis week was, in work terms, truncated: A bank holiday plus a day off on Thursday made the week feel even shorter than normal. Since Thursday I have been up in Suffolk for a little mini-gathering of the clan, seeing my niece, her husband, and their two lovely children – the children for the first time ever. They all live over in Adelaide, where my brother and his wife settled over thirty years ago. An outpost of the Betteridge’s, established.\n\nBecause I’m quite a bit younger than my siblings being a great-uncle has come pretty early. I’m less than 20 years older than my youngest niece, which means we share quite a few cultural references, probably more than my siblings in some ways. And my niece’s lovely husband (who once managed to absolutely charm my mother, which gives him bonus points) is a wonderful, lovely guy, too.\n\nSpending time away from home is good, but I’m less enamoured of living out of a rucksack than perhaps I would have been twenty years ago. I love being away, but the prospect of being at home in my own bed is what makes travelling special. The journey may indeed be the reward, but being able to soak in my own bath for a couple of hours is also part of the journey, in a way.\n\nThis week I have been reading <em>Beyond the light horizon</em> by Ken Macleod, the third in a series which I have quite enjoyed. It’s a nice near-future romp which features submarines which are actually spaceships, a mysterious alien intelligence, and a European Union that’s developed into a more communistic union – and which works better. Thank you Ken for painting a picture of a near future that’s not totally wrecked. I enjoyed the first volume a lot, thought the second lagged a little (as second volumes often do) and am enjoying the third one a lot more so far.\n\nThis week I also bought a new iPad, the 11in iPad Pro with the spangly new M4 chip in it. As a bit of background, I actually had two iPads: an M1 12.9in, and a recent iPad mini. Since I bought the MacBook Air M2, the 12.9 – which was intended to be my travelling machine – has hardly had much use. The 11in iPad Pro is intended to replace both, and be the device I take on trips and while commuting.\n\nThis trip to Suffolk was its first journey, and it’s done really well. The new keyboard is a delight to type on. While I didn’t mind the previous Magic Keyboard, this is a far better feel and more akin to the excellent MacBook Air keyboard. It’s also – of course – a great book reader, and I have spent a lot of time reading on it. The screen is great, but honestly the screen on every iPad I have ever owned has been great. Is it noticeably better than the older iPad Pro? Not to my old eyes, but that’s because the older iPad Pros already had great screens.\n\nMore importantly battery life is good, largely (I think) thanks to the shift to OLED and the power-sipping qualities of the M4. Does it need all that power? No. Will there be applications in the future where it’s required? Almost certainly. Roll on WWDC in a few weeks.\n",

				"content_text": "There’s a lot of AI in this edition. Sorry. One day I’ll stop talking about it, probably when silenced by the machines. For those whose interests are less one dimensional, I’ve included some actual culture towards the end.\n<h2>1. Google zero is icumen in</h2>\nAs Nilay Patel writes, “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience\">the entire business of the modern web is built around Google</a>”. We, as publishers and makers of stuff, have allowed the ludicrous situation where a single company has effectively enclosed the web. And it’s not like we weren’t warned. But as Nilay also writes, and I’ve written about extensively, that era is coming to a close. The consequences of this will be huge and painful but the key point for publishers is simple: don’t let it happen again.\n<h2>2. Reader, they are letting it happen again</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.verdict.co.uk/openai-partners-with-the-atlantic-and-vox-media-which-media-companies-have-already-made-deals/?cf-view\">Oops</a>.\n<h2>3. “Publishers lack strategic patience”</h2>\nFocus on your audience. Do great journalism. Get it to your readers. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/fatal-flaw-publishers-making-openai-deals/678477/\">Don’t sell your Crown Jewels</a>. Jessica Lessin, who has built a successful subscription business based on exactly this process, notes that publishers lack strategic patience, which is one of the reasons they constantly jump into bed with tech platforms then wonder what happened when the platforms treat them as suppliers and not partners. This is completely correct: publishers are not good at strategically cultivating a long-term relationship with their audiences. That would require investment and hard work, rather than focusing on short term revenue.\n<h2>4. Who amongst us etc etc</h2>\nAnd that’s why <a href=\"https://futurism.com/advon-ai-content\">you end up with companies like AdVon</a>, which specialises in in producing cheap AI-generated affiliate content which gets published on well-known brand sites. How do brands like USA Today or Sports Illustrated end up putting something which is obviously going to damage brands over the long time on their sites? Because they have no long term strategy.\n<h2>5. Now this makes sense</h2>\n“A new theory: somewhere in the Silicon Valley universe there’s a cadre of techies who have eidetic memories and they’re feeling them start to slip. Panic time.” <a href=\"https://netwars.pelicancrossing.net/2024/05/24/microsoft-can-remember-it-for-you-wholesale/\">Wendy Grossman</a> (who you should read every week) makes me feel a bit seen. I was arguing earlier in the week about how Microsoft’s Recall feature was a boon to people like me who are getting to the point in their lives where memory isn’t as much of a given as it used to be. Is it a good feature? Unknown until we have hands on with the code and implementation. Is the principle that machine learning should happen on-device a good one? Yes.\n<h2>6. Black boxes you can trust</h2>\nNow this will be interesting: <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/05/29/apples-ai-plans-involves-black-box-for-cloud-data?utm_medium=rss\">Apple is rumoured to be planning to implement a black box system for cloud-processed AI features</a>. Given the company’s PR line on privacy, this would make sense – and might actually put some pressure on others to do the same.\n<h2>7. Fixing old computers is the hotness</h2>\nThe Canon Cat is one of the more fascinating old computers, designed by Jef Raskin after leaving Apple and probably much closer to his original vision for the Macintosh than Steve Jobs’ cut-down Xerox Star. <a href=\"https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2024/05/refurb-weekend-canon-cat.html\">This article goes through restoring one</a>, which means diving deep into the hardware with some interesting historical asides.\n<h2>8. Under-sung hero of the week</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/article/2024/may/17/will-fashions-flamboyant-powerhouse-isabella-blow-finally-get-her-dues\">Isabella Blow</a>.\n<h2>9. “We conflate all these scales of harm”</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/may/04/rebecca-f-kuang-yellowface-joan-didion-poppy-war-babel\">A fascinating interview that I had missed with RF Kuang</a>, who talks about everything from so-called cancel culture to why she’s very bad at taking holidays (something we share).\n<h2>10. What was new is old now</h2>\nI never really got on with New Atheism, for the same reason that I never really got on with hardcore rationalists: it smelled like macho bullshit dressed up in pseudo-scientific clothing. <a href=\"https://defector.com/the-ghosts-of-new-atheism-still-haunt-us\">The recent trend of new atheists turning out to be ardent supporters of transphobia and hostility towards pro-Palestinian activists</a> makes me think my gut feeling about them was correct. New atheism was always a conservative and reactionary movement, led by privileged white men as convinced of their own infallibility as the hardcore religious they spent so much energy opposing. “New Atheism will continue to haunt us for as long as we refuse to acknowledge that the way things are always includes the possibility that things could be different.” Amen to that.\n",

				"content_text": "What a weird week. You might have noticed Microsoft had a few announcements. I'm not going to dwell on them – but what I will say is that moving AI from the cloud to the device while preserving privacy is hard, but a lot easier than keeping AI in the cloud. And so to the links…\n<h1>1. Privacy sandbox is coming, and publishers might be in (more) trouble</h1>\nDoes Google hate publishers? You should know all about “privacy sandbox”, its not-really-private way of using aggregate data to target ads to people, which will just cement its position as Lord of The Ads. One thing that still isn't clear is if, in fact, publishers that don't use it will get downranked in search. At a time when AI answers and Google's general love of all things Reddit are already making them suffer. <a href=\"https://pressgazette.co.uk/marketing/fears-google-could-down-rank-publishers-who-decline-to-use-privacy-sandbox/\">It will neither confirm or deny this</a>. Which usually means it's going to do exactly that. If you're a user, <a href=\"https://kagi.com\">Kagi is over there</a> (and it's incredibly good).\n<h1>2. Speaking of the media apocalypse…</h1>\n<a href=\"https://werd.io/2024/dispatches-from-the-media-apocalypse\">This is one of the most depressing things I have read in quite some time</a>. Audience from social media: dying. Audience from Google: dying. CPMs: Hilariously bad. One slight positive: Journalism has always existed with various business models, and it's not always been about scale and advertising.\n<h1>3. Ben and Satya talk cricket. Oh, and AI</h1>\nI've always loved Ben Thompson's work, even though I often don't agree with him these days. <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/interviews-with-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-and-cto-kevin-scott-about-the-ai-platform-shift/\">This long interview with Satya Nadella</a> is worth a read in its entirety, and no, it doesn't feature cricket. Well only a bit. Related: I recently set up a new PC. What sport did it automatically show me in the widgets? Cricket. I see what you did there, Satya.\n<h1>4. Twenty-four hours</h1>\nDid you know that <a href=\"https://japanupmagazine.com/archives/8268\">the Japanese used to have their own system of timekeeping</a> which had longer or shorter segments depending on the time of year? And they built beautiful, elaborate clocks to tell time in it? I didn't, and now I really want to use that time system myself.\n<h1>5. Not sent from my iPad</h1>\nMG Siegler -- who, I am glad to say, is back writing regularly about tech -- hits the nail on the head <a href=\"https://spyglass.org/not-sent-from-my-ipad/\">about the latest iPad</a>, and iPads more broadly. It's frustrating when you hit a wall with software like Safari, and you hit a wall far too often.\n<h1>6. Reading comprehension and the age of AI</h1>\nIt's <a href=\"https://joanwestenberg.medium.com/the-death-of-critical-thinking-will-kill-us-long-before-ai-781fdd23cc7c\">not just AI that threatens the truthfulness of our politics and culture</a>: we have also lost, in some cases, the ability to read and comprehend long-form, detailed content. We have become the tldr; society.\n<h1>7. The coming apocalypse in UK universities</h1>\nUnless you work in the sector, you might not realise quite how stuffed UK universities are. And when I say “stuffed”, I mean “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/article/2024/may/19/next-government-must-make-hard-university-funding-decisions-fast\">pretty close to technical bankruptcy and no longer able to carry out their core function”</a>. It's yet another thing which the inevitable Labour government is going to have to pick up and fix, with both short and long-term measures required.\n<h1>8. No, today's AI isn't sentient (but this article is rubbish)</h1>\nThere are few people with any knowledge of AI who claim that today's large language models (LLMs) are sentient, but <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/time100-voices/6980134/ai-llm-not-sentient/\">that's the straw man this article starts with</a>. Worse, though, is to follow. Despite it being co-written by a proper professional philosopher, the writers seem blissfully unaware that its insistence human-style embodiment is required for AI is one of those points that has been debated for longer than computers have existed. Read, but then read some proper philosophy of AI.\n<h1>9. Media companies are making the same mistakes with AI they make with all new tech</h1>\nJessica Lessin has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/fatal-flaw-publishers-making-openai-deals/678477/\">written a good piece for The Atlantic</a> on how media companies' rush to make deals with the likes of OpenAI to provide access to their content is short-sighted and stupid. She's right: it is. When are media companies going to learn that when tech companies refer to “media partners” they mean “suckers”?\n<h1>10. How do you become a writer? You write</h1>\n<a href=\"https://lithub.com/ursula-k-le-guin-on-how-to-become-a-writer\">Oh Ursula, how right you were</a>. She was talking about fiction, but the same is true of any kind of writing. How do you become a journalist? <a href=\"https://www.oblomovka.com/wp/category/living-on-the-edge/\">Write journalism</a>.\n",

While far too many publishers took one look at large language models and saw a way to make the cost of content significantly cheaper, my background in audience development told me straight away that the ability of LLMs to ingest content and spit out a summary was going to fundamentally change search engines, to the long-term detriment of publishers. Why click on a link when Google can give you an answer?</p>\n<p>Ben Thompson – still one of the sharpest commentators on the relationship between tech and media – this the nail on the head when he talks about <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2024/the-great-flattening/\">LLMs as an extension of aggregation theory</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>LLMs are breaking down all written text ever into massive models that don’t even bother with pages: they simply give you the answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Google's announcement at Google I/O that it would <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/14/24155321/google-search-ai-results-page-gemini-overview\">roll out AI Overviews on search pages in the US</a> seems to have finally got people's attention. Google is, of course, claiming this will <strong>increase</strong> clicks to publishers, which seems barely credible -- and the fact it's not giving publishers any way to see if a click originates from AI Overviews in Google Search Console suggests it really doesn't want anyone measuring that claim.</p>\n<p>And don't think as a publisher you can opt out. The only way to do that is to opt out of search entirely. While you can opt out of being crawled for use in the Gemini chatbot, you can't opt out of AI Overviews on its own.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents\">Gartner estimates</a> the fall in traffic down to having AI-driven answers on the results page at between 35-60%, which would be a catastrophic fall for most publishers.</p>\n<p>I think this is only the start: AI answers are not conversational, and for many situations – especially purchases – a conversational interface is generally superior to a simple text search. Turning search into a conversation is a huge step and it's likely to further impact publishers as a new generation gets used to \"talking\" to a machine to get exactly the answer they want.</p>\n<p>So what should you do? The only way forward is to build direct audience, and focus on owning the relationship between you and the reader without being mediated by the large platforms. That may mean subscription - but it could also mean focusing on a smaller but highly valuable audience, wether that's a niche in the B2B market or focusing on building community rather than giving answers.</p>\n<p>Treat your existing ad revenue and affiliate revenue as a cash cow, not a growth market. Although my gut feeling is that AI Overviews won't impact on affiliate content as heavily as the kind of answers-based pages which have been big traffic drivers for the past few years, <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/03/06/the-future-of-search-driven-affiliate-content/\">their time will come too</a>.</p>\n<p>Be entertaining – remember that audiences don't just read content for information, they want to be entertained, provoked into thought, and to come away from an article or site feeling like it's really delivered. That probably means raising the quality of your writing – think <em>New Yorker</em> or <em>The Verge</em>.</p>\n<p>But most of all: be yourselves. Don't try and be anyone else. For as long as I've been in publishing one of its scourges has been the reverse of \"not invented here\": a kind of belief that competitors are somehow ahead of you, that they have their strategy straight while you're still stuck in some kind of technological or content strategy dark ages. It's never been true: everywhere I've worked has felt the same way about whoever their competitors were.</p>\n<p>You need to know your audience better than Google does, better than Facebook does. Can you do that? I think you probably can.</p>\n",

First, it allows TSMC, who will be manufacturing the M4, to start with relatively small volumes. iPad’s sell well: iPad Pros, on the other hand, are a smaller part of the mix, and probably lower volumes than the MacBook Air or low-end MacBook Pros, which would have been the other option for a new chip.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, there is probably a performance price to be paid for that “tandem OLED” screen. Tandem OLED, by the way, is <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Device-structure-of-a-a-conventional-OLED-and-b-a-tandem-OLED_fig1_303035219\">not a new thing</a>. As reported by <em>The Elec</em> back in 2022, <a href=\"https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3874\">it looks like Samsung could be the manufacturer</a> although LG Display also makes tandem OLED, mostly for the automotive market. In addition to brightness, tandem OLED gives <a href=\"https://www.oled-info.com/apple-aims-adopt-tandem-oleds-its-next-ipad-pro-tablets\">increased lifespan and better burn-in resistance</a>, both of which are important with a device that’s designed to be used for long periods of time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But third is the marketing factor: by putting M4 first in the iPad, it shows that the iPad is still an important platform for the company. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One small point of note: Apple talks about M4 having “<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-introduces-m4-chip/\">up to 10 cores</a>”, but <em>some</em> models have less. The iPad Pros which have less than 1Tb of storage use a nine-core M4, and get 8Gb of RAM rather than the 16Gb of the high-end models.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This makes sense, because those iPad Pros with 1-2Tb of storage are going to be bought either to do video or because the customer has a stupid amount of money and wants “the best”. But Apple is not particularly transparent about this: go to order, and you won’t find a mention of the difference. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course there’s a new Apple Pencil Pro, but the second generation Apple Pencil, which a lot of current Pro owners will have, doesn’t work with it (the lower cost USB-C variant does). That means  an even more expensive upgrade for existing users, who will also need to buy a new Magic Keyboard. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More importantly than the cost, Apple had a chance here to make a point that the iPad’s modular nature means you don’t have to throw away your accessories every time you upgrade. It chose not to do that, and that’s disappointing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another trick that Apple has missed is not improving the battery life, which remains at the usual “ten hours” or “all day battery”. And it’s not that iPad is <em>bad</em> on this score. But the Mac is now so much improved that it’s no longer the go-to device if you want something which is going to reduce your charging anxiety to nothing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve said it many times now, but the M2 MacBook Air has been a revelation. It turns my computer from being something where I needed to ensure I had a charger with me to a device that gets charged overnight, like my phone. For someone whose first laptop got a couple of hours that is a huge mental shift, so much so that it took me a while to racing to the nearest wall socket once I saw the battery monitor drop down to 50%.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Battery life is the biggest factor which keeps me using the Mac right now. The iPad should get the same length of use, and it just doesn’t. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>The iPad Pro’s place in the universe</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For a lot of us, technology is as much a hobby and a passion as a tool. We love computers because we love them as objects, not just because of what they allow us to do. I fell in love with the iPad in this way from the first day I got my hands on one, in a car park in Basingstoke where I bought a first generation one for cash from a guy who had just come back from a US trip, before they were released in the UK.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apple often talks in a way which makes my marketing-cynical eyes roll, but its description of the iPad as a “magical sheet of glass” is, to me, real. A computer that’s just a piece of glass, that you can use as a slate when you want, as a creative powerhouse, as a book, as a TV, and that is capable of transforming its physical form by use of accessories to do all those things well – that’s something amazing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The iPad should be that <em>one device</em> but somehow, 14 years down the line, it’s still not. My gut feeling is this comes down to the restrictions which Apple continues to place on what developers (and customers!) can do with it <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/05/07/on-the-ipad-becoming-a-mac/\">compared to the Mac or any real computer</a>. All of the arguments people make about customer benefits to a locked-down ecosystem don’t apply to a computer which is designed to be your main device. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>About <em>that</em> ad</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don’t think I have ever known Apple <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153113/apple-ipad-ad-crushing-apology\">apologise for an ad before</a>. It has quietly withdrawn them (including the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5BLs51yDQ\"><em>What’s a computer?</em> iPad ad</a>, which I liked but you won’t find now on an Apple channel), and it has had duffers that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-SJQdREDKM&amp;pp=ygURYXBwbGUgbGVtbWluZ3MgYWQ%3D\">it would rather people didn’t remember</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/09/dhh-crush\">Like John Gruber</a>, I didn’t really think it was <em>that</em> bad on first viewing, although it did strike me as pretty tone deaf. It definitely didn’t get the message across, which was that the iPad can be all these wonderful creative things. Instead, it focused on the destruction of creative things, which isn’t “at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts” at all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But thinking about it more, Apple should have predicted the reaction to it. It isn’t the plucky underdog anymore: it’s one of the biggest technology companies in the world, and people are (justifiably in my view) wary of it because of that. Where perhaps 10 years ago people would take its environmental claims at face value and believe it’s control freakery was down to a desire to deliver the best experience for customers, now less people want to give it the benefit of the doubt. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Including, of course, me. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Yes, Apple, we're also talking about you</h1>\n<p>Cal Newport reckons that it's <a href=\"https://apple.news/AFn3BueEOSOaFoU2tiD_t2g\">time to dismantle the technopoly</a>. Taking a cue from Neil Postman's (great) book, he defines this as the “submission of all forms of cultural life to the sovereignty of technique and technology.” Postman was writing in 1992(!) but if you think about the technopoly as it exists today, we're really talking about how every single technical development is thought of as an unalloyed good, from AI scraping the whole of human knowledge to Apple crushing creative tools into a product it sells (at a 40% margin). We'll come back to that one later.</p>\n<h1>2. And speaking of dodgy corporate behaviour</h1>\n<p>Along comes Google, which – against the orders of the DOJ – <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/google-destroyed-chat-history/\">routinely destroyed internal communications</a>. The only reasonable conclusion is it did this deliberately. A fine will be just “cost of doing business”. It's time to dismantle corporate repeat offenders.</p>\n<h1>3. Maybe Facebook might end up interoperable</h1>\n<p>Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act has been a target of the far wing for a while, who see it as a charter for “big tech” to stifle <em>their</em> speech (which, of course, means not letting the right stifle the speech of its enemies). But <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/02/kaiju-v-kaiju/\">as Cory Doctorow explains</a>, it's also the only thing which stops big tech companies from censoring anything which <em>might</em> cause them to end up in court for libel. More than that, though, a case which is currently going through the courts might end up with Facebook and others being prevented from messing with tools which let you customise your feed on their services – for example, by filtering out all that “for you” crap which the algorithm wants you to get angry about.</p>\n<h1>4. This week's product I am a little obsessed with</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://craigmod.com/roden/091/\">An e-reader that's the size of a phone and runs Android</a>? You have no idea how hard it is for me not to hit the buy button on this one.</p>\n<h1>5. Hey, so what about that Apple ad?</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/09/dhh-crush\">Like John Gruber</a>, I didn't think too much about Apple's “crush” ad when it was shown as part of the introduction of the new iPad Pros (more on those anon). But the more I thought about it, the more I realised quite how tone deaf it was. The intention was to show all those wonderful creative tools being squished into an iPad, which could do it all. The execution was showing many lovely things being destroyed. How did that get past Apple's senior team? That's the bit which, if I were an Apple shareholder, I would worry about.</p>\n<h1>6. And so on to the product I'm not obsessed with</h1>\n<p>Yeah, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24151128/apple-ipad-pro-2024-hands-on\">new iPad Pros</a>. Yeah, M4 processor. Yeah… same old iPadOS. For about the tenth year running, I'm left hoping this will be the year when Apple finally produces an operating system that can make the most of all that power. I suspect I'm going to be disappointed, again.</p>\n<h1>7. Tesla is doomed, redux</h1>\n<p>Honestly, if I held Tesla shares, I would be looking to sell them at the earliest opportunity I could take a profit. Unless Western governments intervene plenty of car companies will go to the wall because when it comes to quality EVs, <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/features/719015/china-is-ahead-of-west/\">Chinese manufacturers are miles ahead</a>. So why am I mentioning Tesla is particular? Because it's vulnerable, and the stock is still massively overpriced because Musk has managed to convince <s>suckers</s> investors Tesla is a tech leader.</p>\n<h1>8. Where the world of scams is going</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/308c42af-2bf8-47e4-a360-517d5391b0b0\">It's going to get really bad</a>. Five years from now, this kind of fake person attack will be both commonplace and convincing, and I really don't know how we combat it.</p>\n<h1>9. You can't have it both ways, Elon</h1>\n<p>“<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/10/elon-musks-x-loses-lawsuit-against-bright-data-over-data-scraping.html\">X Corp. wants it both ways</a>: to keep its safe harbours yet exercise a copyright owner’s right to exclude, wresting fees from those who wish to extract and copy X users’ content.” This is another example of how the safe harbour provisions of US law for internet companies are a double-edge word. On one hand, they protect them from libel based on what their users say. On the other hand, they can't then claim all the intellectual property rights over that content as if they were publishers. X Corp isn't the only company to want a smorgasbord of rights, though: Meta had previously made the same kind of claim, and lost.</p>\n<h1>10. “<a href=\"https://www.jwz.org/blog/2024/05/blockchain-rasputin-over-here-is-mad-that-moderation-exists/\" title=\"Permalink to Blockchain Rasputin over here is mad that moderation exists\">Blockchain Rasputin over here is mad that moderation exists</a>”</h1>\n<p>Headline of the week, easily.

The Mac is here to stay, something that didn’t seem like a sure thing five and a half years ago. It feels like it’s time for Apple to accept this state of affairs. macOS isn’t just one of Apple’s platforms—it’s a feature, a secret weapon that it can use to make all its other platforms more powerful when they need to be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t have any idea if Apple really has any intention of letting macOS run on other devices, whether it’s an iPad or a Vision Pro or even an iPhone plugged into an external display. But it seems to me that if there’s any Apple product that is flexible enough to make it work, it’s the iPad Pro.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was a big iPad Pro user for quite a while, and a proponent of its simplified but powerful operating system. There are plenty of apps on the iPad which are brilliant, and developers have done a lot with the platform.</p>\n<p>Since I got an M2 MacBook Air, though, my use of the iPad Pro has fallen away almost to nothing. While Apple has long billed the iPad Pro as its most versatile computer, capable of being a tablet, a laptop, or whatever, when it comes to the most important thing of all – software – the iPad isn't versatile enough.</p>\n<p>I can't install another browser which uses a different rendering engine. All browser plugins have to be installed via an app store. I can't get software of any kind from anywhere except an app store. Although the file system has improved, it's still limited compared to that of a more open platform like the Mac.</p>\n<p>And of course, if I ever decided I wanted to take my expensive piece of hardware and install a completely different operating system on it, well… tough.</p>\n<p>When people talk about wanting the iPad to be a Mac, what they're ultimately saying is they want the platform to be more open because all of the decisions that Apple has made which lead to it being inferior to the Mac are about keeping it more closed. And I'm going to hazard a guess, given the way Apple has had to be dragged through a legal process just to open up a little, that's not on the company's agenda.</p>\n<p>But I would love to be proved wrong.</p>\n",

Microsoft takes security seriously (again)</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyone old enough to remember Windows in the 90s knows what an awful, insecure mess it was. In 2002, Bill Gates sent out a memo on “trustworthy computing” and, within a couple of years, Windows security had improved massively. Now, Satya Nadella is doing the same thing – but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24148033/satya-nadella-microsoft-security-memo\">his memo isn't quite as good</a>. It's overdue: Windows has, once again, become a buggy mess and where there are bugs there are security holes. Why now?

It notes that it often focuses on scandals, personalities and sensationalism due to competitive pressures in the media industry, rather than, you know, actual insight into tech. And they are right, but I think even if you look outside the mainstream it's pretty dire. Try reading the kind of in-depth technical analysis you got in <em>Byte</em> magazine and then looking through even Ars Technica (which is good by today's standards) and you can see the difference. This is mostly down to economic pressure: at least from the perspective of journalists themselves, research shows that <a href=\"https://www.revistacomunicar.com/index.php?contenido=detalles&amp;numero=45&amp;articulo=45-2015-15\">when times are tough, quality declines</a>.

It's almost as if those people did things which were, perhaps, important to the business. Seriously though, if you allowed your company to hire 1500 people who weren't actually needed, then you're a bad leader and should pay the price for that.

Here is a man with few redeeming qualities, who used government funding to create a web browser which he turned into a large pile of cash for himself, railing against the government.

Qualcomm cheating on the benchmarks for its upcoming “nearly as good as Apple's chips, no really, this time we're not lying” Snapdragon X Elite would be a fantastic scoop. But I don't believe it. Why not? Simply because the stakes are too high, and the rewards too low, for it to be worth Qualcomm doing it.

Why? Because Apple desperately wants to avoid parts from old phones getting back into the market to be used for repair by third parties, who will do the job more cheaply than Apple. Why does it want that? Because it wants you to buy a new iPhone, rather than getting your perfectly good one repaired.

Unlike plenty of corporations, as soon as that became a problem, it changed the rules so it could work with suppliers who paid worse wages, didn't provide health insurance, and so on. Google, of course, is blaming someone else – in this case the National Labor Relations Board, which ruled that these rules meant Google was effectively a co-employer of its partners' staff. Blaming other people is, of course, standard corporate behaviour these days.

The company has a weak product pipeline – the Cyberdog… sorry Cybertruck is a distraction – and its share price has collapsed because it's no longer considered a growth stock.

Technology companies are often valued by their potential for future growth, and Tesla was no exception. But at one point it was also valued at more than the rest of the car industry put together. That's well beyond potential future profits and into bubble territory – unless you believe that at some point in the future, Tesla would have had a monopoly on cars. Now, of course, it faces competition, and unsurprisingly, the traditional carmakers build better quality vehicles than Tesla, and the Chinese companies build them cheaper AND better.

Real-world marketers could never get away with tracking us like online marketers do… Just because there is now a multi-billion-dollar industry based on the abject betrayal of our privacy doesn’t mean the sociopaths who built it have any right whatsoever to continue getting away with it. They talk in circles but their argument boils down to entitlement: they think our privacy is theirs for the taking because they’ve been getting away with taking it without our knowledge, and it is valuable. <strong>No action Apple can take against the tracking industry is too strong.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/04/edpb_meta_pay_or_ok\">John Gruber in 2024, on the EU's actions which limit Facebook's ability to track users</a>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What makes this all the more outrageous is that many major publishers in the EU use this exact same “pay or OK” model to achieve GDPR compliance — and none offer a free alternative with non-targeted ads. Don’t hold your breath waiting for Der Spiegel to offer free access without ads. Christ, they don’t even let you look at their homepage without paying or consenting to targeted ads. And Spotify quite literally brags about its ad targeting. But Spotify is an EU company, so of course it wasn’t designated as a “gatekeeper” by the protection racketeers running the European Commission… They’re not saying “pay or OK” is illegal. They’re saying it’s illegal only if you’re a big company from outside the EU with a very popular platform.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_24_1161\">I wonder what happened</a> to turn John's attitude from “no action Apple can take against the tracking industry is too strong” to defending Facebook's “right” to choose how it invades people's privacy? Or is he suggesting that a private company is entitled to defend people's privacy, but governments are not?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And John's second point about Spotify fundamentally misunderstands the nature of antitrust law in general and the EU gatekeeper system specifically. In competition, actions which are legal when you're not a monopoly become illegal when you are a monopoly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In particular, Apple – and Facebook – <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_6423\">are gatekeepers because they</a> “are digital platforms that provide an important gateway between business users and consumers – whose position can grant them the power to act as a private rule maker, and thus creating a bottleneck in the digital economy”. Spotify is not in that position. Der Spiegel is not in that position. Different rules apply – as they do to Tidal (not an EU company), and of course to the New York Times. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This really is not difficult to understand.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But underneath this in part is John's feeling that EU antitrust law is all an EU conspiracy to attack American companies. That would be news to Daimler, fined over a billion euros for an illegal cartel. It would news to Scania, fined 880m euro. To DAF, fined 715m euro. To Phillips, fined 705m euro. <a href=\"https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/document/download/b19175c3-c693-410b-b669-27d4360d359c_en?filename=cartels_cases_statistics.pdf\">And so on</a>. The EU fines European companies big sums of money all the time for breaking competition law. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The entire point of the EU is to create single, competitive markets. It does not allow big companies to “own” markets because free markets (in the EU's eyes) are good, and privately owned ones that allow big companies to stop being capitalists and <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/18/in-extremis-veritas/\">act like feudal lords are bad</a>.

The idea that telling the people who ultimately pay your wages – those who read your content or watch your videos – the truth about a product is “almost unethical” is indicative not just of Vassallo’s views, but those of the tech executives who have grown up in the last 20 years.

It made a handsome profit on it, probably between 30-40%. At that point, Apple should no longer be able to stop me from doing what the hell I want with the product I purchased. So yes, the fact that it does exactly that is problematic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apple doesn’t do that on the Mac I’m typing on.

That argument is weak, because people's needs evolve and what people want evolve. Maybe now I'm super-happy with the way that Springboard works. And perhaps in a year's time Apple will introduce a new version, which sucks. But I won't be able to replace it with a third party alternative, despite the phone being a year old, despite it being perfectly good.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because, of course, I don't own my phone, despite that money I paid for it, despite that margin Apple got.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The EU isn't just concerned with today. It's really taking Steve Jobs’ advice and listening to the Wayne Gretzky quote: it’s skating to where the puck is going, not where it’s been. Its aim is to ensure that two very large companies don’t own the market for smartphones to such a degree they can determine everything that happens in those markets, to their advantage. The EU is a capitalist body: its obsession is keeping markets open, and it will do anything it needs to do to make sure that happens. They can act now, or they can act later when the adjustments required – both for big companies, third parties and consumers – would be far greater.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The obvious solution would be for the European Commission to pass a law banning targeted advertising. But I suspect they haven’t done that, and won’t, because so many publishers in the EU use targeted advertising (along with “pay or OK” subscription offerings). They don’t want to eliminate all targeted advertising, just Meta’s (and Google’s), but that’s hard to put into written law while claiming not to be targeting very specific American companies.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The EU prefers not to ban products outright.

Laws affecting it include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/ED).</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>a little thing called the GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016.

This is the point that John highlights Thierry Breton making:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the DMA is very clear: gatekeepers must obtain users’ consent to use their personal data across different services. And this consent must be free! We have serious doubts that this consent is really free when you are confronted with a binary choice. With the DMA, users who do not consent should be provided with a less personalised alternative of the service, for example financed thanks to contextual advertising. But they do not have to pay.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The EU told Meta explicitly that its contract with users was a problem. Rather than change the contract substantially to stop violating the law, it chose to offer a different contract for paying customers. The point isn’t that a paying option is or is not popular: it’s that Meta has tried to evade what the courts have explicitly told them to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As American companies are learning, the EU does not like companies that try and do an end run around the law. This appears to have dawned on Apple, which has already – in the space of a few weeks! – widened its plans to comply with the DMA and DSA. Perhaps not enough, which is why the EU is investigating them. But the mood from Apple has definitely started to change from sullen evasiveness to being more open to compliance. It's not yet at the point of working to make a good compliant product for its customers, but it's getting there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One other point of course: Breton’s comments are demanding that Meta implement a system in a way <em>similar to that which Apple forced them to do on iOS</em>. App Tracking Transparency made Meta, and all other app makers, ask if the app could track them – and <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/11/14/one-year-how-apple-s-privacy-changes-are-still-hurting-meta\">Apple didn’t give a damn that it would cost Meta $10bn</a>. Apple also wouldn’t have accepted an opt-out where Meta charged you if you opted out of ATT. John’s argument seems to be that it’s fine for Apple to do things to protect the privacy of its customers, but it’s not OK for the EU to do the same for everyone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consider too that if Meta goes along with this interpretation by the EC of the DMA’s requirements, and offers a vastly-less-lucrative free-of-charge option to use Instagram and Facebook without targeted ads in the European Union, there’s nothing to stop regulators and legislators around the world from demanding the same. Conceding to this might mean not just generating only a fraction of Meta’s current revenue in the EU, but generating only a fraction of its current revenue worldwide.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To which I can imagine Breton giving something of a gallic shrug. Because, again, the point of the EU – its very purpose – is to ensure that markets are free and open. The idea that a single company should determine what markets can and cannot be open is an existential threat to the EU.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Breton — after casting a stink eye at Google for presenting its own hotel, flight, and shopping recommendations in web search results, and at Amazon for promoting its own Amazon-branded products (a shocking practice for a retailer — good luck ever finding Kirkland products at Costco, Up &amp; Up at Target, or, say, Ol’ Roy dog food at Walmart, right?)…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s just pause at this point and remind ourselves that <a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/statistics/search-engine-market-share\">Google has 91.62% of the search engine market</a>, and repeat – again – that the rules of what you can and can’t do as a business change when you have a dominant market position.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>(Aside: the FTC and other antitrust bodies are, in fact, <a href=\"https://archive.is/3KsYW\">casting their eyes on the likes of Walmart too</a>.

I’m guessing they’d see even less benefit if entire popular services and products are removed from the EU market.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Leaving aside that John is linking as “proof” to a Reddit thread with precisely nine comments on it, most of which are from US users and none of which sound particularly outraged, this misses the point of antitrust action entirely, doubly so in the EU. So, for what feels like the 900th time, I’ll explain it:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The point of antitrust action is to ensure that markets remain competitive, because over time competition spurs innovation and ensures prices are optimal.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s it. That’s all. It’s not about immediate prices – although over time, competition lowers them. It’s not about “making customers happy” – although, over time, competition leads to happier customers, because it spurs innovation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s understandable that people with a American view of antitrust based on recent history might not get this. The focus in US antitrust since the early 1980s has been on prices, <a href=\"https://lithub.com/cory-doctorow-why-our-current-tech-monopolies-is-all-thanks-to-ronald-reagan-and-robert-bork/\">thanks to the noxious influence of Robert Bork</a>. In Borkian antitrust, all that mattered was prices, and, in his weird head, monopolies led to lower prices for consumers. That this went against pretty much every economic theory since (and including) Adam Smith didn’t matter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thankfully US antitrust bodies appear to have cottoned on to how bizarre Bork’s approach was and are abandoning it. But if you haven’t been paying attention to antitrust history and have grown up since Reagan, you probably don’t understand the change.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a footnote, John notes this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One obvious solution would be to show more ads — a lot more ads — to make up for the difference in revenue. So if contextual ads generate, say, one-tenth the revenue as targeted ads, Meta could show 10 times as many ads to users who opt out of targeting. I don’t think 10× is an outlandish multiplier there — given how remarkably profitable Meta’s advertising business is, it might even need to be higher than that. But showing that many ads would be such a bad experience that I suspect it would land Meta right back where they are today with the paid subscription option, with the EC declaring it non-compliant because users don’t want it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And here’s the thing: <em>that’s fine</em>. It’s fine because, instead of having a business model reliant on invading people’s privacy, largely without their consent or even any kind of transparency, Meta would be forced to compete <em>without</em> doing those things. It would be forced to make a product which respected people as people, instead of exploiting its undoubted market power.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am totally fine with that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maybe 10 ads would be enough to maintain its current level of profits. And maybe that would make users unhappy. And maybe then another company would come along and offer a similar service with five ads, and people could choose to use it because it’s a better experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that might push Facebook to make its service more efficient, or lower its margins, so it could offer five ads too. Perhaps it could charge a higher price for them because it found technical ways to do better targeting while staying within the bounds of the law. Or maybe Facebook would die and be replaced by something else, just as MySpace, FriendFeed, and all those other early services fell by the way side because they weren’t as good an experience as Facebook.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s how competition works. Not by lock-ins, tying, bundling, “walled gardens” (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3606073\">that you can’t easily leave</a>). All of those things are symptoms of a market out of control. The EU, which up till now has mostly confined itself to measures like GDPR which just ameliorate the symptoms, has decided it’s going to try curing the disease itself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

They were, though, two volumes of the same work: <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09T6WHLJQ/\">Dream Makers</a></em> by Charles Platt. It’s a set of interviews with science fiction writers, originally published in 1980, and updated by Platt with more historical context – basically what happened next to each author.\n\nApart from some annoying typos and unpleasant formatting (Platt is self publishing the ebook versions) it’s well worth the couple of quid each one will set you back. Everyone is in here, from Asimov and Clarke to members of the New Wave. Even L Ron Hubbard is there.\n",

First up, if you do not respect Walt's opinions, you're a fool. Walt is one of my tech journalism heroes. That said, I think he's missing a couple of points here.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Walt is correct that the vertically integrated model has been Apple's since the start. But what is permissible when you're a small company or in a nascent market is no longer permissible when you are in a position of market power. And no one doubts that Apple is in a position of significant market power, not least Apple itself.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, like most people, Walt is being tripped up by the word \"monopoly\". The <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/atr/antitrust-laws-and-you\">DOJ definition makes absolutely no mention of a percentage:</a> it talks only of \"market power\". That's why the DOJ's filing is careful to refer to Apple having both market power AND significant market share.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Back to market power. Does Apple have it? Well, Apple has certainly -- publicly -- said so. Remember Apple very happily talking about the $1.1 trillion in developer billings and sales made through the App Store in 2022? As Apple owns that app store, it's almost a dictionary definition of market power being exerted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And this is another thing which people will get tripped up over: market power doesn't just mean power over the market where you sell goods: it's also about your control of markets adjacent to that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example: Microsoft had no market power in PC manufacturing. It didn't make PCs. But it did have huge market power in operating system software, which it could (and did) leverage to control things in PCs to its favour. OEMs didn't have to sign the contract which MS put in front of them, in theory. In practice, they did, even though MS wasn't a part of their market, because of the power Microsoft had in operating systems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was one of the new aspects of the Microsoft/DOJ case which, outside academic circles, didn't get noted: it was the first major case which focused on the network effects of having monopoly power in one market could mean in other markets. Although the Clayton Act made tying one product to another illegal, generally that was within the same market, not in adjacent ones.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are keen to know more about how the Microsoft/DOJ case redefined some aspects of antitrust, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcle/article-abstract/6/1/33/791748?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">this paper from 2010</a> is a good read.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Walt notes that he doesn't think there's a right for other companies to use Apple's IP, which is proprietary to them. And he's right, up to now. But in a situation where monopoly power exists, the game changes. Remember that IBM's 1956 consent decree forced it to not only publish technical data freely but also license its patents under fair terms (including some which had to be royalty-free).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is another case of \"what was legal becoming illegal\". IBM developed those patents: it's monopoly power meant that it was prevented from using them in a way which would otherwise be legal. And, of course, the IBM 1956 consent decree basically created the PC industry as we know it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of this is going to trip many people up. How can a company have market power when it doesn't have a 80%+ share of a market? Why are we talking about third-party developers when Apple doesn't compete (much) against them? Isn't Apple just trying to protect their customers?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would urge everyone to read The Verge's coverage because they really know their stuff when it comes to legals. There's going to be a lot of opinions (including from me, sorry). But it will be fun: writing tech news while Microsoft/DOJ and Microsoft/European Commission were on was some of the best fun I had as a reporter. Settle in for a long ride.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One final point: currently, we only have a filing. This is not the point where the DOJ starts talking about/showing its evidence. Does the DOJ have a case? Until we (or rather, the judge) sees evidence, anyone who says they absolutely know is wrong.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Disclosure of the evidence is where things REALLY get interesting. And it's also where things get dangerous for Apple because it has carefully cultivated a brand which focuses on being pro-consumer. Documents which show collusion, patterns of bad behaviour, and more could damage that brand. Get the popcorn ready.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From 1995 through to about 2008, I made my living from technology journalism (we called it “computer journalism” then, because technology really was computer). That means my career almost exactly spans the period of the biggest technology antitrust trials of the lot: <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp\">United States vs Microsoft</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Corp._v._Commission\">Microsoft vs European Commission</a></em>. Most of the original reporting I did was about the EC case (after all, that's my side of the pond) but I did enough reporting and spoke to enough sources to have a decent idea of the nuances of both cases.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Depending on how you look at it, US vs Microsoft (which I'll call “the DOJ case”) was either the last hurrah for a DOJ which had become very reluctant to intervene in anything connected with antitrust that wasn't either a cartel or big merger, or <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1501079\">the first case where network effects were regarded as an important question in competition law</a>. But either way, it was one of the landmark cases in technology competition law, as notable as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System\">the breakup of 'Ma Bell'</a> or <a href=\"http://www.cptech.org/at/ibm/ibm1956cd.html\">the 1956 IBM consent decree</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, based on my specific expertise, I can tell you: Be prepared, over the coming months, for some <em>lousy</em> punditry.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tech commentators (and their audiences) are going to have to learn some history</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An entire generation of tech commentators and CEOs have grown up not understanding the history of antitrust in tech, or the impact it had in shaping the industry. And they really don’t understand that without regulatory action in the 1950s to 1980s, their businesses would not exist.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One simple example: why did IBM not buy DOS outright, a move which would have killed the PC compatible before birth and made IBM dominate for longer? Bill Gates would love everyone to think it’s because he was smart and IBM was not. In fact, it’s because IBM was wary of yet another antitrust suit. As Bill Lowe put it, “IBM didn’t want to be seen as dominating the market too thoroughly.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly, IBM could have bought Microsoft — Gates even offered them 10% of the business, and they could easily have afforded more. In the environment of the past 20 years, where big companies are allowed to buy almost anyone, they would have. Back then, antitrust concerns made it a non-starter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And now antitrust law is being applied again in the way it has been for most of its existence, commentators and tech execs are finding it really difficult to cope with the change. There’s an irony that Tim Cook appears to be affected deeply. After all, Cook started his career at IBM, and moved on to Compaq - a company that wouldn’t have existed without antitrust law. You would think he would get it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you would like to know more about the impact of antitrust on IBM behaviour, I’d recommend reading <a href=\"https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3292&amp;context=faculty_scholarship\">this paper by Tim Wu</a>. In his conclusions, he looks at what antitrust regulators should learn from the case, and I found this paragraph quite relevant to what’s currently happening:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A similar logic suggests prioritizing Sherman 2 cases where the problem isn’t just competition in the primary market, but where competition in adjacent markets looks to be compromised or threatened. The long cycles of industrial history suggest that what are at one point seen as adjacent or side industries can sometimes emerge to become of primary importance, as in the example of software and hardware. Hence, the manner of how something is sold can make a big difference. In particular, “bundling” or “tying” one product to another can stunt the development of an underlying industry. Even a tie that seems like “one product” at the time the case is litigated, as, for example, software and hardware were in the 1960s, or physical telephones and telephone lines, might contribute to such stunting. If successful, an antitrust prosecution that breaks the tie and opens a long-dominated market to competition may serve to have very significant long-term effects</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Expect lots of talk about how previous antitrust action (in particular Microsoft) didn't achieve anything</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Views I have heard in the past few years from some widely known pundits:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Microsoft/DOJ did nothing to change the browser landscape</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Microsoft/DOJ didn't make any difference to Microsoft's ability to “win” in mobile</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Microsoft/DOJ didn't matter because the web</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2023/attenuating-innovation-ai/\">To borrow a phrase from Ben Thompson</a>, these opinions are, to use a technical term favoured by analysts, bullshit. All of them have in common a failure to understand the chilling effects that being under investigation, or under a consent decree, have on corporate actions –– at every level.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In organisations that are under antitrust pressure, ideas that might get put forward are held back, because people would rather not spend the time having them checked through legal and compliance teams. Acquisitions which a company might make don't happen, because it would rather not appear rapacious or that it's stifling nascent competition. And contractual clauses with partners can't be as aggressive in locking them out of doing business in a way which doesn't favour you. That, of course, was one of Microsoft's favourite tricks of the 1990s: the “per processor” licence for Windows, for example, meant that computer makers paid them for a licence on every computer, whether Windows was installed or not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Microsoft tried to tie Internet Explorer to Windows. It was stopped from doing so by the government, and that made it a lot easier for Chrome to gain traction. As Gates said (and Thompson denies!) the “distraction” of antitrust meant that Microsoft wasn't as focused on mobile as it should have been. The “old” Microsoft would also have used specific means to stop the iPhone being as attractive, such as preventing it from connecting to Exchange servers (something that was introduced in iOS 2, in 2008).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Antitrust action works, in part, not just because of the explicit conditions of a consent decree, but because companies limit themselves. They are afraid of getting back into court, because they know that next time a break-up might be on the agenda.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Expect to see a lot of bad commentary because people don't understand “monopoly power” or market definitions</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have already seen a lot of “the iPhone is not a monopoly!” comments, from people who have been in the business for long enough to know better. Let's put that one to bed straight away: “monopoly power” does not require a literal monopoly share of a market. <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/advice-guidance/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/single-firm-conduct/monopolization-defined\">Here's how the FTC defines it</a>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Courts do not require a literal monopoly before applying rules for single firm conduct; that term is used as shorthand for a firm with significant and durable market power — that is, the long-term ability to raise price or exclude competitors. That is how that term is used here: a “monopolist” is a firm with significant and durable market power. Courts look at the firm's market share, but typically do not find monopoly power if the firm (or a group of firms acting in concert) has less than 50 percent of the sales of a particular product or service within a certain geographic area. Some courts have required much higher percentages. In addition, that leading position must be sustainable over time: if competitive forces or the entry of new firms could discipline the conduct of the leading firm, courts are unlikely to find that the firm has lasting market power.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is why <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1344546/dl?inline\">the DOJ filing</a> talks about “monopoly power” and how Apple “also enjoys substantial and durable market share”:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apple has monopoly power in the smartphone and performance smartphone markets because it has the power to control prices or exclude competition in each of them. Apple also enjoys substantial and durable market shares in these markets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Note the “also”. The DOJ case does not rely on a specific high number for Apple market share: it relies on showing that Apple has significant market power.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But one of the key elements in any antitrust case is the definition of the markets you're referring to -- because defining the market helps understand the degree to which a company has monopoly power. The DOJ filing talks about two markets, hence the title of section E: “Apple has monopoly power in the smartphone and performance smartphone markets”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The DOJ claims that Apple <em>itself</em> says it has a 70% market share in the second one:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the U.S. market for performance smartphones, where Apple views itself as competing, <strong>Apple estimates</strong> its market share exceeds 70 percent</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I can't locate a source for Apple saying this, but I have no doubt at all that the DOJ can back up both the number, the market definition, and that Apple has said -- publicly or internally -- that it is the market it competes in. Market definitions are <em>so</em> important to antitrust cases that the DOJ just would not have included that statement without evidence to back it up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>(And no, Apple, you can't play it like the market share that's relevant is the global number.

This is fine</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm almost boring myself now whenever I post anything about the era of mass search traffic for publishers drawing to a close. But then someone comes up with a new piece of researching showing <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/googles-gen-ai-search-threatens-publishers-with-2b-annual-ad-revenue-loss/\">an impact of between 25-60% traffic loss because of Google's forthcoming Search Generative Experience</a>. The fact that Google effectively does not allow publishers to opt out of SGE — you have to opt out of Googlebot completely to do so — should be an indication that Google has no intention of following the likes of OpenAI in paying to license publisher content, too. And I think the SGE is just the first part of a one-two punch to publisher guts: computers and how we access information is going to become more conversational and less focused on searching and going to web pages. As that happens, the entire industry will change, and it could happen faster than we think.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.

They don't interrogate or question terms (because they have no concepts, so can't), there is no individual voice, they make no daring or original claims based on the evidence, and much more. My particular favourite — and one I have encountered a lot — is that LLMs <em>love</em> heavy sectionisation and simple adore bullet points. I've got LLMs to write stuff before, specifically telling them not to use bullet points, and they have used them anyway. <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/willpooley.bsky.social/post/3knq223hv2t2d\">As Tim succinctly put it in a post on Bluesky</a>, LLMs create content which is “uniformly terrible, and terribly uniform”.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.

Smarter people than me are still analysing the impact of that update, but one thing which stood out for me is there was a big chunk of manual actions to start. Manual actions are, as the name suggests, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/craig-wright-not-satoshi-nakamoto-bitcoin-creator-ruling/\">based on human review of a site</a>, which means they are a kind of fallback when the algorithm isn't getting it right. And guess what the manual actions mostly targeted? <a href=\"https://originality.ai/blog/google-march-2024-manual-action-ai-update-list\">AI content spam</a>. All the sites that were whacked had some AI-generated content, and half of them were 90-100% created by AI. Of course, manual action is not a sustainable strategy to combat <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/01/24/the-information-grey-goo/\">AI grey goo</a>, but it should be a reminder to publishers that high levels of AI-generated content are not the promised land of cheap good content without those pesky writers. <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/01/19/how-to-roll-out-ai-in-a-creative-business/\">If you want to use it, do it properly</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9.

Some things are pretty easy — swapping Gmail for Proton isn't hard (and Shubham missed out some tricks, like using forwards to redirect mail). But it's <em>really</em> difficult to avoid some products, like WhatsApp or LinkedIn, because there are few/no viable alternatives. That, of course, is just how the big tech companies like it because they long-ago gave up on the Steve Jobs mantra of making great products that people wanted to buy in favour of making mediocre products that people have no alternative to using.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/e148fbcce3.jpg\"> \n",

The short version: Apple doesn’t understand that regulating markets and preventing them from splitting away from the single market and into the control of private companies is an existential threat to the EU. The EU was founded to bring peace through a single market. It’s really not going to let Apple, or Google, get away with this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.

Falling from nearly $1.7m in 2016 to just $75,000 in 2023 is quite the decline. There are many factors involved, and as Josh notes, they have focused much more heavily on subscribers than programmatic, but even so, that’s a lot of money to lose in a relatively short amount of time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. “If Steve were alive…”</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m not generally a fan of the “if Steve Jobs was alive this would never have happened” approach to Apple punditry, but there is something in the view that <a href=\"https://gamesfray.com/steve-jobs-turning-in-his-grave-as-eu-tells-apple-we-wont-let-you-silence-critics-like-epic-games-pr-waterloo-30b-risk/\">the current shenanigans with the EU would never have happened if Steve were still around</a>. Make no mistake: Steve Jobs was no saint. But his focus was very much on simply <em>making better products than anyone else.</em> This applied to making an App Store in the first place: anyone old enough to remember the pre-iPhone era of mobile software can remember how dreadful discovery, payment and so on were. Having an App Store was a huge step forward. These days, app stores are the default and everyone makes one – but not on iOS because rather than compete to make the best App Store, Apple has chosen to try and maintain a monopoly for its own financial well-being. I like to think that Steve wouldn’t have done that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7.

And he’s right!

In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/mar/05/techscape-open-source-software-cryptocurrency\">The Guardian, Alex Hern</a> makes the excellent point that even if you assume developers “owe” Apple something for making great software which makes platforms more attractive to users (I do not think this), then they are already paying out quite a chunk of money. Of course, there’s the $99 developer fee. But developers also need to buy Macs to make iOS/iPadOS apps: someone like Spotify might be spending millions of dollars per year with Apple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9.

It also makes some serious points: the amount of money that creative people earn has stagnated in actual terms, which means it has declined in real terms. Freelance writing is a good example of this. I’ve done work for publications where the word rate hasn’t inched up in 20 years. I know because I literally have the receipts, as I worked for them back in the early 2000s. Meanwhile, executive salaries in creative industries have… well, let’s just say they aren’t having to sell the second home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/apple_epic_developer_account\">Daring Fireball: Apple Terminated Epic’s E.U. Developer Account</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I guess Epic is implying that the EU government, not Apple, should have that discretion? They don’t say so, but who else but Apple could have that discretion? But the European Commission isn’t set up for that sort of police work. That’s not how the EC works. The DMA doesn’t say that the EC now runs app marketplaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, regulating markets is <em>exactly</em> the thing that the European Union is set up to do &ndash; the foundation of the EU as a whole is the Single Market, and anything which threatens to fragment the single market into something smaller, under private control, is to be resisted at all costs.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/facing-reality-in-the-eu-and-tech/\">Baldur Bjarnason put it in an excellent post recently</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Much like roaming, App Stores let private companies subdivide and control the single market to their own financial gain. When much of the digital economy is taking place on phones, tablets, and various other devices that are largely limited to App Stores, this is effectively ceding the single market to a fragmented market that’s entirely under corporate control. This is against the core operating theory behind the EU.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What Apple isn&rsquo;t getting is this isn&rsquo;t something that the EU is going to roll over for. As Baldur also notes, this is explicit in the naming and intention of the Digital Markets Act &ndash; whenever you see the word &ldquo;market&rdquo; in EU regulation it&rsquo;s a tell that the intention is to bring an area into the scope of the single market, when the EU believes it has been out of alignment.</p>\n<p>Regulating markets isn&rsquo;t just a small thing for the EU. It&rsquo;s existential. As Baldur puts it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To Apple, the App Store is a side line. To the EU, the single market is the foundation of its existence. Any time you see two entities of similar size fight, bet on the one that thinks it’s fighting for its life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later on, John mentions that Spotify has been as publicly-critical of Apple as Epic, and it hasn&rsquo;t had its developer account revoked.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Spotify, for example, is just as vociferous a corporate critic of the App Store as Epic is, and Apple hasn’t threatened them with revocation of Spotify’s developer program membership. The difference between Spotify and Epic isn’t in their rhetoric; it’s in their past behavior.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There&rsquo;s another key difference: revoking Spotify would be a much bigger deal, both practically and politically. Spotify has around <a href=\"https://explodingtopics.com/blog/music-streaming-stats\">a third of all streaming music users</a>, double its nearest competitor &ndash; which happens to be Apple. Spotify has 226 million paying subscribers, and a lot of them will use iPhones. Being told they can no longer use their Spotify account would undoubtedly mean that next upgrade cycle some of them would choose to move to Android.</p>\n<p>The politics would also be terrible. Using your power over a market to ban the number one service where you are number two is exactly the kind of move which would land Apple in a world of legal pain. By comparison, banning Epic was nothing.</p>\n<p>The level of bad behaviour that Spotify would have to get up to in order to Apple to ban them would have to be so egregious, obvious and public that ignoring it imposed a bigger cost than removing their developer status. I&rsquo;m not sure what that might be. Given that Apple never ever blinked when <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/\">Facebook was complicit in genocide</a>, I can&rsquo;t imagine what Spotify would need to do to get banned. Launch its own nuclear weapons? Despite Apple&rsquo;s protestations, the rules of the App Store game are very different for developers that are strategically important to Apple.</p>\n<p>Why is Apple, a company that&rsquo;s not exactly composed of <a href=\"https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Golgafrinchan_Ark_Fleet_Ship_B\">B-Ark players</a>, getting this so wrong? I wonder about this a lot. In my professional life, I&rsquo;ve known a lot of people at Apple. I worked there for a short time. I was in daily contact with them while working on <em>MacUser</em>. 99.99% of those I&rsquo;ve met have been good, smart people. Some of them are still friends.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m certain the same is true for John, and I would, not that long ago, have posed a very similar question to him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But why not take an opportunity to look magnanimous? Apple shouldn’t be expected to grovel, but this looks like they’re <a href=\"https://x.com/paulg/status/1765431238985187525?s=20\">going out of their way to look vindictive</a>. I really thought it would be a clever bit of public relations jujitsu to make nice with Epic, even if, in Cupertino, it was through gritted teeth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the answer to this lies in a gradual change I&rsquo;ve seen in the way the company behaves since (and I hate saying this) Steve Jobs died. In her recent <em>Burn Book</em>, Kara Swisher cites something that Jobs said to her:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By 2010, Apple’s market valuation would surpass Microsoft’s, a major milestone. A week later, Jobs was back on the ATD stage and I asked him if he had a thought or two about that. “For those of us who have been in the industry a long time, it’s surreal,” he responded. “But it’s not why any of our customers buy our product.

				"content_text": "\n\n[Daring Fireball: Apple Terminated Epic’s E.U. Developer Account](https://daringfireball.net/2024/03/apple_epic_developer_account):\n\n> I guess Epic is implying that the EU government, not Apple, should have that discretion? They don’t say so, but who else but Apple could have that discretion? But the European Commission isn’t set up for that sort of police work. That’s not how the EC works. The DMA doesn’t say that the EC now runs app marketplaces.\n\nActually, regulating markets is *exactly* the thing that the European Union is set up to do -- the foundation of the EU as a whole is the Single Market, and anything which threatens to fragment the single market into something smaller, under private control, is to be resisted at all costs. \n\nAs [Baldur Bjarnason put it in an excellent post recently](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/facing-reality-in-the-eu-and-tech/):\n> Much like roaming, App Stores let private companies subdivide and control the single market to their own financial gain. When much of the digital economy is taking place on phones, tablets, and various other devices that are largely limited to App Stores, this is effectively ceding the single market to a fragmented market that’s entirely under corporate control. This is against the core operating theory behind the EU. \n\nWhat Apple isn't getting is this isn't something that the EU is going to roll over for. As Baldur also notes, this is explicit in the naming and intention of the Digital Markets Act -- whenever you see the word \"market\" in EU regulation it's a tell that the intention is to bring an area into the scope of the single market, when the EU believes it has been out of alignment. \n\nRegulating markets isn't just a small thing for the EU. It's existential. As Baldur puts it:\n\n> To Apple, the App Store is a side line. To the EU, the single market is the foundation of its existence. Any time you see two entities of similar size fight, bet on the one that thinks it’s fighting for its life.\n\nLater on, John mentions that Spotify has been as publicly-critical of Apple as Epic, and it hasn't had its developer account revoked. \n\n> Spotify, for example, is just as vociferous a corporate critic of the App Store as Epic is, and Apple hasn’t threatened them with revocation of Spotify’s developer program membership. The difference between Spotify and Epic isn’t in their rhetoric; it’s in their past behavior.\n\nThere's another key difference: revoking Spotify would be a much bigger deal, both practically and politically. Spotify has around [a third of all streaming music users](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/music-streaming-stats), double its nearest competitor -- which happens to be Apple. Spotify has 226 million paying subscribers, and a lot of them will use iPhones. Being told they can no longer use their Spotify account would undoubtedly mean that next upgrade cycle some of them would choose to move to Android.\n\nThe politics would also be terrible. Using your power over a market to ban the number one service where you are number two is exactly the kind of move which would land Apple in a world of legal pain. By comparison, banning Epic was nothing. \n\nThe level of bad behaviour that Spotify would have to get up to in order to Apple to ban them would have to be so egregious, obvious and public that ignoring it imposed a bigger cost than removing their developer status. I'm not sure what that might be. Given that Apple never ever blinked when [Facebook was complicit in genocide](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/), I can't imagine what Spotify would need to do to get banned. Launch its own nuclear weapons? Despite Apple's protestations, the rules of the App Store game are very different for developers that are strategically important to Apple. \n\nWhy is Apple, a company that's not exactly composed of [B-Ark players](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Golgafrinchan_Ark_Fleet_Ship_B), getting this so wrong? I wonder about this a lot. In my professional life, I've known a lot of people at Apple. I worked there for a short time. I was in daily contact with them while working on *MacUser*. 99.99% of those I've met have been good, smart people. Some of them are still friends. \n\nI'm certain the same is true for John, and I would, not that long ago, have posed a very similar question to him:\n\n> But why not take an opportunity to look magnanimous? Apple shouldn’t be expected to grovel, but this looks like they’re [going out of their way to look vindictive](https://x.com/paulg/status/1765431238985187525?s=20). I really thought it would be a clever bit of public relations jujitsu to make nice with Epic, even if, in Cupertino, it was through gritted teeth.\n\nI think the answer to this lies in a gradual change I've seen in the way the company behaves since (and I hate saying this) Steve Jobs died. In her recent *Burn Book*, Kara Swisher cites something that Jobs said to her:\n\n> By 2010, Apple’s market valuation would surpass Microsoft’s, a major milestone. A week later, Jobs was back on the ATD stage and I asked him if he had a thought or two about that. “For those of us who have been in the industry a long time, it’s surreal,” he responded. “But it’s not why any of our customers buy our product. Remember what we’re doing and why we’re doing it. Sometimes you just have to pick the things that look like they’re going to be the right horses moving forward. We’re trying to make great products. Have courage of our convictions … Customers pay us to make those choices. If we succeed, they’ll buy them, and if we don’t, they won’t.” \n\nJobs loved making money as much as the next billionaire, but not for the usual reasons. He didn't regard it as a measure of him, personally. It was a measure of how much people loved Apple products, because they chose to buy the best. And when making products, the question of what delivered the best for the customer was always at the heart of decisions.\n\nApple today sees the App Store, too, as a product. It regards its role as delivering the best experience for customers, by keeping out crap apps, setting standards, making sure customers aren't ripped off, and so on.\n\nWhich leads me back, again, to the last line of that Jobs quote: \"Customers pay us to make those choices. If we succeed, they’ll buy them, and if we don’t, they won’t.\" Jobs knew that the pressure of competition was what kept Apple -- and all companies -- honest. \n\nWith the App Store, customers aren't allowed to choose. Apple doesn't compete by being the best. Apple succeeds by **being the only option** -- and that is corrosive to any company culture. My fear that it's corroded Apple's culture, too.\n",

First, though, something that’s a bit of a theme for me: the long-term unsustainability of the affiliate/SEO content model...</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This screen grab neatly illustrates why I think search-driven affiliate content has no long-term future:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":140004953,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/44833a3030.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-140004953\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you're a publisher, and you have an affiliate-led revenue strategy, you might want to start thinking about what your revenue model will be in a few years. Conversational AIs are going to massively impact on your ability to monetise.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is an image from a query performed using Google Gemini Advanced, and the answer to my question includes links directly to retailers for users to just buy the recommended products. No affiliate intermediary required. And remember: Gemini will be the default voice assistant on Android, eventually. I haven’t seen good data on how many affiliate purchases take place on mobile versus desktop, but it’s likely to be the majority.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Conversations generative AI tools like Gemini are not good enough yet for purchasing (and that's true of most generative AI) but it will be, and probably sooner than you think. In nearly thirty years of covering technology, I don't think I have seen a new tech that's improved as rapidly as generative AI. It's gone from laughable to serious in 18 months, and I suspect that pace will continue given the money and resources pouring into it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For purchasing decisions, conversational interfaces will ultimately be better for users, as they allow them to hone down recommendations based on personal priorities. I could talk to Gemini and say, “OK, I have a mix of hard wood floor and carpets, what would you recommend?” I can change price ranges, asking if there's a really outstanding model just above what I'm looking to spend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's going to take, I think, between three and five years to get to the point where the technology is good enough, but it will get there. If you have affiliate revenue now, I would strongly recommend you invest what you're making in a long-term strategy of building more direct traffic, and more direct revenue from consumers (in whatever way is appropriate to your market).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You might have noticed that online media is currently in trouble, with layoffs happening virtually everywhere you look. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7168624907096989696/\">Dave Ruddock has written an excellent summary </a>of why – and in particular, why now. It’s a quintuple whammy of Google, consolidation, affiliate, AI and the death, for publishers, of the distribution platforms they have come to rely on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dave finishes with “get out of media while you can, folks. It’s a bloodbath” and I sympathise with that view a lot. Paul Newman, who is MD of tech at Future, points out in the comments that this may just be the end of a cycle, and he’s right to say that the media business goes in cycles. When I’m optimistic, I think the next cycle will be all about direct traffic, paid for via subscription, and a resurgence of quality over pageviews. But the pessimist in me notes that getting there is going to be very painful, for businesses and for individuals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other major concern I have is the loss of experience in the industry. If you’re in your 50s now and someone dangles a decent carrot of redundancy money in front of you, you’re probably going to take it and go off to do something other than active journalism.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But it’s deeper than that. I had a conversation recently with a freelance tech writer of many years standing, who told me he no longer bothers even pitching to write reviews. Publications now want a “best of” with 10 products in it, and want to pay £200 for it – and actually properly testing 10 products takes a lot longer than than half day that £200 should pay for.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That freelancer represents decades of experience in technology and testing products. That’s all now effectively lost to the industry, never to return. Crafts which bleed knowledge like that rarely see an increase in quality over time, and if we are moving to a new era of quality content, we will need – somehow – to get that back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a more “admin” note, I’m thinking about expanding what gets emailed out to subscribers, and would like to hear your views.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the moment, the mid-week newsletter is the only thing anyone gets via email. Other posts are all web-only.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have started a regular link post on Fridays called “<a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/category/linkblogs/\">Ten Blue Links</a>”, which covers a broad range of everything that’s interested me. I am thinking of sending this out by email too. I also do occasional longer posts on things which I have found interesting, again mostly in tech. And on Sundays I write a weeknote, which is a more personal reflection of what I’m up to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As an experiment I’m going to send out Ten Blue Links via email, as well as the mid-week post. I’m hoping this will be of value to you. Ultimately, I want to move to an email system which allows you to sign up to one, or both – but for now it will have to be all or nothing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let me know what you think either in the comments below <a href=\"mailto:cheery.cat6879@fastmail.com\">or by email</a>.

Google is a strange company in many ways (someone once described it to me as \"a university research division funded by an adtech company) and I suspect it's at a crossroads.

How publishing is losing its soul</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There have always been publishers whose relationship with advertisers was a little too cosy. Even back in the days when selling ads was like shooting fish in a barrel with a bazooka, ad sales people would try a little “friendly chat” with a journalist to \"check in and see how product X is doing\". Most journalists always told them, in a friendly way, where to get off. But as times get tougher and things get more desperate, it's natural that executives are going to lean on journalists to \"do the right thing for the company\" rather than for their audience. <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/02/08/cnet-insiders-say-tech-outlet-softened-coverage-to-please-advertisers/\">This piece, from a year ago, is about CNET</a>, but I guarantee they are not the only ones doing the same. Private equity companies only care about getting a return on their investment as soon as possible. They aren't concerned about the long-term viability of a brand — and they definitely aren't concerned about the people reading the content. Of course, once they have fired all the journalists and replaced them with “prompt engineers” that will be problem solved because there will be no one left to complain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.

Desperate times make desperate publishers</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's not that long since publishers were wary of getting into a legal tangle with the likes of Google because they wanted to keep the provider of most of their traffic onside, but these days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/28/news-media-europe-google-lawsuit-ad-revenue\">things are different</a>. I don't know whether this will be successful or not — despite my 'O' level in law, I am not a lawyer — but I'm absolutely certain that Google's 50,000 gorilla-like presence in the adtech market distorts it in a variety of ways. Let's not even start on Facebook. Yet. The one caveat to all this is that $2.3bn is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/#:~:text=Google%3A%20annual%20advertising%20revenue%202001%2D2023&amp;text=In%202023%2C%20Google's%20ad%20revenue%20amounted%20to%20237.86%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars.\">1% of the amount the company made from advertising last year</a>, so it's another case of what sounds like a high number to publishers actually being cost-of-business to Google.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. At last, the worst use of AI (special government edition)</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm not against the use of LLMs for summarisation. In fact, sometimes it's one of the best uses for it. LLMs can be really good at picking out the salient points of an email, for example, and if you have ever worked in a corporate environment you know quite how much long emails are used to hide important points. But using it for <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f2ae55bf-b9fa-49b5-ac0e-8b7411729539\">creating drafts of routine responses and to summarise reports for ministers</a> is a recipe for worse government. Why? Because good ministers get into the details of this stuff. Yes, they have many decisions to make, but not getting into the details of your brief leads to awful, hand-waving, big-picture-details-are-for-losers government. Most ministers don't know enough about the topic area when they start — this will only encourage them not to be immersed in it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. How not to do layoff communications</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the things I studied on my leadership masters was how to manage layoffs, and later on, I saw at first hand how excellent leaders and managers do it. I've seen the seriousness and discipline it takes to so redundancies in a way which is humane, deeply considers how the communications will work, and also looks hard at the effects of redundancies on the remaining part of the business. It's always horrible, but it doesn't have to be either deliberately cruel or handled ineptly. So, I wonder, what is it about tech companies <a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email?utm_source=feed&amp;utm;_medium=rss&amp;utm;_campaign=feed\">that makes them so awful at it?</a> My gut feeling is that it's partly down to the culture of the hero founder/CEO: basically, leaders who are not prepared to listen to anyone with actual experience of doing this stuff professionally.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9. Green trade rules are \"biased\"</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When Piyush Goyal, India's trade minister, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/51dc962a-6cc0-49ad-b941-0e0942216d63?accessToken=zwAAAY31KSUPkc9R3JYqbMBJrdO5QQ4JQiFtYw.MEUCIEzF_e05xyMDJU7Rsz5lys0Vu4wDEMKIK-X37bR6s0_CAiEA-AZPoYSb6uoWeuBbNc_BXDoiLZvXWBl8FT4lauZnGew&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise\">told the FT that rules inserted into trade agreements with his country designed to reduce carbon emissions were \"biased\"</a> he got a lot of stick, and a lot of it was classic “greedy Indians” racist nonsense from people who should know better. The fact is that he's mostly right: the West is expecting India (17% of the world's population, 3% of its carbon emissions) to stop lifting people out of poverty while the US (4% of the world's population, 15% of its emissions) doesn't reduce its emissions anywhere near fast enough. As Goyal put it, \"all the environmental damage that has been done in the past has still not been made up for. What about that? Before we add new environmental issues, let’s first sort out who is responsible for the environmental degradation. Certain promises were made in Paris. They have to be delivered upon.” Just as it would like everyone to forget quite how much of its wealth came from colonialism, the West would love people to ignore how much it has benefited from pumping vast amounts of carbon into the atmosphere we all share. Climate colonialism is alive and well and living… well, here.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10. How the Tories radicalised me</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I often note how the government's Prevent programme, designed to stop radicalisation, ought to look at the role of the Tory party. Recently, Tory party membership has been a bigger marker of someone being against traditional British values like free speech and the right to protest than anything else. Lewis Goodall wrote a very good piece about the radicalisation of the Tory party, and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/comment/2024/02/tories-conspiracy-party\">how it's now more or less in thrall to conspiracy theories</a>. Certainly, 14 years of Tories has radicalised me: I've gone from soft left to full-on \"end capitalism now\", which is an unexpected return to my politics of 40 years ago. I should, at least, thank the Tories for opening my eyes again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Other than, as my friend Cory Doctorow has noted, the 1.5 good products it invented itself (<a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2020/06/05/afrofuturism/\">“a search engine and a Hotmail clone”</a>), the most successful Google products are acquisitions. Android? <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/culture/google-buys-android/\">Acquired</a>. YouTube? <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna15196982\">Acquired</a>? Adtech? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/14/technology/14DoubleClick.html\">Acquired</a>. Even Chrome, which dominates web browsing in a way which many people (including me) find more than a little scary, was <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/googles-new-chrome-browser-based-on-webkit-updated-3x/\">based on Apple’s WebKit</a> rendering engine – which was, in turn, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/07/the-unforking-of-kdes-khtml-and-webkit/\">based on the open source KHTML</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The fact is, Google is <strong>incredibly</strong> bad at successfully bringing products to market, to such a degree that <a href=\"https://killedbygoogle.com/\">no one trusts them to do it and stick with it for long</a>. It continually enters markets with fanfare, only to exit not long after. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take social networking. You probably remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B\">Google+</a> (2011–2019). You may even remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orkut\">Orkut</a> (2004–2014). Perhaps you know about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Buzz\">Google Buzz</a> (2010–2011). But do you remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaiku\">Jaiku</a>, an early Twitter competitor which Google bought – and buried? The resources of Google could have been used to accelerate Jaiku’s development and – perhaps – win the battle against Twitter and the nascent Facebook. Instead, the company took two years rebuilding Jaiku on top of Google’s App Engine, with no new features or marketing spend to support the product. Two years later, they killed it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What Google is pretty good at is producing research. Its <a href=\"https://blog.research.google/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html\">2017 paper on transformers</a> directly led to many of the large language model breakthroughs which OpenAI used to create ChatGPT. Failing to spot the potential for its research isn’t <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/silicon-valley-apple-steve-jobs-xerox-437972\">unknown in</a> <a href=\"https://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/kodaks-first-digital-moment/\">technology history</a>, but really great companies don’t allow others to turn themselves into <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/openai-unicorn-valuation-china-zhipu-thrive/#:~:text=OpenAI's%20Valuation%20Reportedly%20Set%20To,Announces%20%24342M%20In%20Investments\">competitors worth $80 billion</a> on the back of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And particularly not when those other companies create technology which directly threatens core businesses, in this case, Google’s “one good product” – search. The bad news for Google is that even in the middle of last year, research showed people using ChatGPT for search tasks <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372075166_ChatGPT_vs_Google_A_Comparative_Study_of_Search_Performance_and_User_Experience\">performed just as well as using a traditional search engine</a>, with one exception — fact checking tasks. That, of course, is a big exception, but ordinary people use search engines for a lot more than just checking facts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What’s also notable about the same research is that ChatGPT levelled the playing field between different educational levels, giving better access to information for those who have lower educational achievement. That strikes at the heart of Google’s mission statement, which promotes its goal of “organis[ing] the world’s information and <em>making it universally accessible and useful</em>” (my italics). Search, as good as it is, has always required the user to adapt to it. Conversational interaction models, which ChatGPT follows (the clue is in the name), change that profoundly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781422196021\">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a></em>, Clayton Christiansen talks about the difficulties that successful companies have in sustaining innovation. Established businesses, he notes, are excellent at optimising their existing products and processes to serve current customers (this is called “sustaining innovation”). However, they often struggle when faced with a “disruptive innovation” – a new technology or business model that creates a whole new market and customer segment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the potential solutions to this which Christiansen looks at is structural: Creating smaller, independent units or spin-offs tasked with exploring the disruptive technology can allow them to operate outside the constraints of the main company. This, of course, is probably what Google intended to do when it changed its structure to create Alphabet, a group of companies of which Google itself is just one part.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest problem with this putative solution is that if you do it well, innovation doesn’t necessarily flow to where it is most needed. Google’s search products needed to seize on the research made in 2017 and integrate it. It didn’t, and – worse still – no one saw this as a potential disruption of the core business. The blinkers were too firmly on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps that’s changing. Notably, <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/april-ai-update/#:~:text=We've%20been%20an%20AI,to%20deliver%20on%20our%20mission\">last year that Google moved all its AI efforts into a single group, Google DeepMind</a>. The “Google” in its name is significant: previously DeepMind was a separate business within Alphabet (and, in true Google style, <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/01/27/google-acquires-british-artificial-intelligence-developer/\">it was acquired rather than built in-house</a>). Now, on the surface, it looks likely to focus more on continuing Google’s mission, which means disrupting the traditional ten blue links.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Can it succeed? I’m not optimistic (<a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2023/10/23/seo-will-be-over-for-publishers-you-need-to-adapt/\">publishers, take note</a>). What we have here is a company which is good at research, but not at exploiting it; whose history is of one good product and a good Hotmail clone; that has a terrible record of announcing, releasing, and killing products, often multiple efforts in different categories all of which fail; and which has failed to keep its core product – search – up to date.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps the real question isn’t whether Google has reached the end of the line, but how exactly it made it this far?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/2da148cfcb.jpg\"> \n",

My first job in publishing was in <em>MacUser's</em> testing labs, where we would regularly have 10–20 products in and – literally in some cases – take them apart to decide which one was best. Next door was the <em>PC Pro</em> labs, which did the same thing, on an even bigger scale. On a visit to New York a few years later, I went to the testing labs of a US publisher: even bigger, with people who looked like they should be wearing lab coats picking over the bones of machines. The product testers were real experts, often devising unique tests designed to stretch the products in ways which matched up the real-world pounding they would take. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But those were proper group tests. What HouseFresh is writing about is not those. Their focus is the “best” article, written specifically to deliver affiliate clicks and sales, and designed to hit a specific keyword. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The HouseFresh article rips the lid off some of the worst aspects of content written to deliver sales though affiliate links (I refuse point-blank to call it “comtent”, which has to be one of the worst words ever invented). Their biggest complaint is that a lot of the pages you will see which rank highly on Google for affiliate-led keywords are written by people who have never had the products in their hands, let alone tested them. They may have done desk research, which involves, at best, scouring spec sheets for hidden details and, at worst, just scouring the user reviews on Amazon. But that doesn't tell you all that much about a product and whether it's any good or not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, this is really Google's fault because it is rewarding low-quality content by ranking it highly. This content, which is far cheaper to produce than a real group test, can be churned out quickly. A quick writer can do one or two a day, while a group test might take two weeks to organise, test and write. Use an LLM and you can probably make that process even faster. Just make sure to write your prompt to make it include phrases like our lab tests and our experts said to satisfy Google's pretty surface-deep view of how content based on real-world experience works.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>HouseFresh’s hope is that Google will improve its algorithms and start rewarding content which is of higher quality, but I have my doubts. <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2023/10/23/seo-will-be-over-for-publishers-you-need-to-adapt/\">I suspect that the company’s focus is on creating “answers engines”</a>like Gemini, rather than the traditional ten blue links. And even if it can improve its algorithms to prioritise in-depth reviews, gaming the SEO system will often look like a better option to many of the kind of publishers HouseFresh is attacking: the ones who have bought well-known brands but now use them to churn out lower quality content. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are, and will be, exceptions, mostly from publishers who have a heritage in creating brands, rather than the ones that buy brands just for their heritage. But the sheer volume of content created by others could drown them out—especially as LLMs make it easier to generate entire sites within days.<a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/01/24/the-information-grey-goo/\"></a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I have <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/02/01/adapting-to-the-new-reality-of-search/\">pointed out,</a> I believe businesses based on this kind of affiliate-led content will also be disrupted over the coming few years by conversational AI. Once people have the option of having a conversation with a smart recommendation engine to tailor buying advice to exactly their needs, “best XXX” articles based on desk research or mining Amazon reviews just won’t be good enough. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Google is a choke point for the affiliate content business, but it’s not the only one. The second is Amazon, where most publishers derive a large chunk of their affiliate revenue. Although reliable numbers are difficult to find, Datanyze estimates Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/affiliate-networks--69\">around 48% of the market share in affiliate networks</a>, and anecdotally, I suspect the amount of revenue that brings in for publishers is higher still. Every publisher I know has sought to reduce their exposure to Amazon, especially after the effective demise of its Onsite Associates programme (known internally as OSP), changes in policy from Amazon would have a massive effect on publishers. But the reality is that if Amazon turned off the taps, or even reduced them, publishers with big investments in affiliate content production would be in trouble. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Would Amazon do this? It depends if you believe that<a href=\"https://craphound.com/news/2023/02/20/tiktoks-enshittification/\"> Cory Doctorow’s enshittification cycle</a> applies to it: </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are we at the point where Amazon starts to claw back the revenue it shares with its “business customers” – affiliate partners? Currently, probably not. But it’s worth thinking about the longer term, too. Already, <a href=\"https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/online-shoppers-search-on-amazon\">61% of US shoppers begin their buying journey on Amazon regularly</a>. That’s traffic which Amazon has to pay no extra commission on, and so it’s something that it would love to do more of. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Plus, of course, Amazon has hundreds of millions of reviews of its own that it could tap to automatically create recommendations for users, including by layering conversational AI on top of it to allow users to get “intelligent” recommendations. The potential is there for Amazon to be a trusted source of reviews, as well as the retailer of choice for online.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The “good” news is that presently, Amazon is struggling with its own grey goo of content in the form of <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/amazon-reviews-are-being-written-by-ai-chatbots.html\">fake reviews generated by AI</a>. It’s responded with more AI to try to trim them out. But the key question is really what happens at the point it decides that the money it spends on delivering affiliate revenue would be better off spent on ads, or on-site AI, or whatever else.<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965334/amazon-uses-ai-to-scan-for-fake-reviews\"></a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ironically, the kind of content mills which HouseFresh is railing against would be less bothered if Amazon does ever scale back on its focus on affiliates: they are, most likely, pretty aware that the brands they are using are near the end of their life, and if the affiliate cash cow moves on the private equity companies will have long since made a sizeable return. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The relationship between Amazon and publishers, like that of Google and publishers, is some kind of symbiosis. Amazon gains revenue from the clicks that publishers drive their way. Publishers get a slice of that money, enough for them to survive and grow. But the key question is whether that symbiosis is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7392539/#:~:text=Obligate%20symbiosis%20suggests%20that%20at,to%20survive%20and%2For%20reproduce.\">obligate – where each depends on the other for survival – or facultative, where each benefits but could survive alone</a>. If it’s the former, affiliate content has a long and profitable future. If it’s the latter, then eventually, publishers who go all-in on it may have a problem. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/d4d025e614.jpg\"> \n",

The bad thing is that you have plenty of things to write about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We’ve managed to fit in two movies in the past fortnight: <em>All of us strangers</em>, and <em>The zone of interest</em>. What a pair of absolute crackers. Go and see them in the cinema, don’t wait till you can stream them or whatever. But then I would say that because I love the cinema, something I have only recently rediscovered.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On a trip to that there London, we managed to squeeze in both exhibitions on at the Courtauld – <em>Cute</em>, and Frank Auerbach – as well as a wander around the newly renovated National Portrait Gallery. Cute was a little disappointing: lots of great objects, but the curation didn’t really tell a story that had any narrative to it. It was more “here’s a thing, here’s a thing, oh and another set of things”. Auerbach is a brilliant artists, but not totally my cup of tea – but he is Kim’s, so that’s fine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The NPG was a place that I was very familiar with. When I worked at Redwood, we were just across the road in a building which is now a hotel, so I often dropped into the NPG at lunch time for a sit and think. The renovation is a huge improvement, not simply for the fabric of the building but also for the way it’s curated. The Victorians, which used to be a gallery of Dead White Men(TM) now actually tells a story of colonialism and empire through almost exactly the same pictures. Also: whoever decided to put Radclyffe Hall in between Churchill and George VI is a genius. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also headed over to Oxford for an overnight trip, seeing our lovely friends and their lovely children and also <a href=\"https://www.hoa.ox.ac.uk/slade-lectures\">William Kentridge doing the fifth of the Slade Lectures Hilary 2024</a>. I wish we had been able to go to the whole series – Kentridge is a brilliant lecturer as well as an artist I greatly admire. Seeing things like that makes me wish I lived in an academic city, instead of in a city which just happens to have two universities bolted on to it. There is a profound difference, and it’s one of the things that I most dislike about Canterbury.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://www.ashmolean.org/exhibition/colour-revolution-victorian-art-fashion-design\">Ashmolean, we saw <em>Colour Revolution</em></a>, which will have closed when you read this. I liked it: in particular I liked the bust of Maharajah Duleep Singh, heir to the Punjab who was forced into exile in England when we stole his land. The bust on display has his actual skin tone. Queen Victoria insisted on a classic, plain white version for herself. If that isn’t a nod to how Indians – even noble ones – were seen by the Victorians, I don’t know what is. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While there, we also caught Monica Sjöö’s <a href=\"https://www.modernartoxford.org.uk/whats-on/monica-sjoo\"><em>The Great Cosmic Mother</em> at Modern Art Oxford</a>. I was not impressed. There is something about the retreat into mysticism which radical politics of the 60s and 70s succumbed to which irritates the heck out of me. It’s particularly true for second-wave feminism: as Michael Moorcock said in <em>The Retreat from Liberty</em>, “being Mother of the Universe cannot offer much consolation while Father is always in evidence somewhere, even if he spends most evenings at the pub.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Coincidentally, Moorcock was also critical of the Greenham protests, which he saw as <em>faux</em> radical with zero chance of actually changing anything, and with little/no consequences if you got arrested. It’s not popular to say so now, but he was right – Greenham changed nothing, and the energy which went into it would have been far better spent campaigning, say, for the police to take rape seriously (which they very much didn’t at the time). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>This week I have been reading…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having finished the 500+ page <em>Babel</em> I dived into the 500+ page <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781473213333\"><em>The Whispering Swarm</em> by Michael Moorcock</a>, and finished it. It's the closest thing Moorcock is likely to write to an autobiography, but of course includes huge strands of fiction in it. Weirdly, he includes many real names of people, but disguises others -- perhaps to make it clear that this is a fictional \"real\" Moorcock too (it's not down to actually needing the disguise people for legal or other reasons -- changing Ballard to Allard isn't going to fool anyone, and with JGB dead there's no issue of libel anyway).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also finished <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9780593716601\">Zoe Schiffer’s <em>Extremely Hardcore</em></a>, which is the story of Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter. If you haven't been obsessively following it this book is an excellent romp through all that's happened. But if you have, there's probably not a lot in here which will either surprise you or that you won't be aware of. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Musk is, of course, the main character. But until the day when he tells his own story, he's a main character that is almost entirely absent. That allows the reader to paint in whatever their own feelings are about him, but it doesn't really answer the question of <em>why</em> he is like this, why he takes these dreadful decisions. Nor does it really tell us mush about how he manages to get away with it, although having more money than is right for any human being is probably part of the answer. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Emperor’s New Clothes definitely applies to those around him, and one of the more interesting parts is the accounts of those who attempted to play along with the Musk regime at Twitter, mollifying him and trying to find ways to do what he wanted without destroying their own values in the process. There will no doubt be a few more of those stories come out over the next few years, and I hope there is ultimately a revised version which tells those too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>This week I have been writing…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last week’s Ten Blue Links was really a collection of <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/02/09/ten-blue-links-tech-is-bad-right-now-edition/\">bad things that are happening in tech at the moment</a>.

Printers are just one example, and not even the most egregious. Every large corporate has spotted that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rentier_capitalism\">charging rents is easier than making good products</a> and competing in a free(ish) market.

Without Daddy Apple keeping us all safe, someone might download a malicious app! The problem is, of course, is that <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/app-store-scams/\">app stores don't really keep you safe</a>, something <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fake-lastpass-password-manager-spotted-on-apples-app-store/\">we saw again this week</a>.

I have heard too many horror stories from academics who have been “encouraged” to ensure that foreign students (who pay a lot of money) pass courses. Like much of the Tory legacy that Labour will inherit, it will take decades to undo the horrific damage this government has done to higher education.

I finished off a feature for <em>PC Pro</em> magazine, which will be the first freelance bit of tech journalism I’ve done for quite some time (I think it’s a good five years since the last one). I also took a trip into London to see one of my former colleagues, and it was great to hear what they have been up to. That includes a project I had encouraged them to do involving offering more work experience placements for young people wanting to get into automotive journalism, and it sounds like it’s been a success.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m excellent at encouraging other people.

For me – a grandchild of the Empire, whose mother left Imperial India as a small child – there are so many elements where both those points hit hard.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":false} -->\n<ul>\n\t<li>As many people have noted, the ultimate platform for augmented reality is something that is both portable (can be worn all the time) and invisible (not a huge set of goggles which get in the way of your interactions with the world. We are <strong>so far</strong> away from this in terms of technology that I would be surprised if we even have it in my lifetime (see also: fully autonomous vehicles that you can drive in).</li>\n\t<li>The price of Apple Vision is not unreasonable given the technology in it. They are not selling this at a loss, and I would expect the margins on it are similar to other Apple products, but Apple Vision is not something that can currently be made at under $1000, which is probably the sweet spot for this kind of tech.</li>\n\t<li>As with the Apple Watch, the company has a set of use cases in mind. As with the Apple Watch, these will almost certainly not be the uses that customers actually find most compelling. Expect the marketing to shift in response to what actually resonates with people. </li>\n\t<li>This represents a minor potential issue for Apple. Apple Watch was priced low enough to have quite a wide spread of customers, especially once the cheaper hardware options appeared after a year or two. Apple Vision is priced too high to get a wide range of customer types. The danger is that it will skew too heavily towards highly-affluent customers, and they kinds of uses they make of devices, for Apple to get much insight into what the <em>real</em> uses of Apple Vision are. Apple doesn’t do much testing with real users (even under NDA) before products are released. That means real-world feedback is vital. </li>\n\t<li>The criticisms that people have made about the battery life are really not that relevant. No one is going to use this wandering around. You’re going to mostly have your behind in a chair. I’ve done a lot of VR demos when moving and nothing breaks the “reality” of the app you’re using than trying to do much in the physical world. Yes, the passthrough video means you <strong>can</strong> do this. But trust me, you won’t. </li>\n\t<li>It’s a shame that you can’t have multiple Mac “monitors” open at the same time. But you can have multiple apps, so I would guess quite a few of the things you want to keep open on multiple monitors will devolve to native apps.</li>\n\t<li>It’s a bigger shame Apple has chosen to only have an App Store model for software. The lack of hackability of the platform won’t matter to most people, but it does matter to me. This isn’t a market of customers who need the same level of “protection” as on a smartphone, so the justification that all apps need to be checked for malware doesn’t exist on this platform. This was a chance for Apple to break with the past. It’s chosen not to do so. </li>\n\t<li>I wonder if, strategically, Apple has ended up “skating to where the puck was” rather than where it’s going to be. It’s taken so long to get Apple Vision out – by some reports, perhaps ten years – that the interest in and relevance of VR and AR has died down. VR’s use cases have mostly boiled down to games. AR is still not really a possibility, at least not in its ultimate form. </li>\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n",

Like the old-school Google we knew and loved (and was useful) I'm going to create a page every Saturday which just lists ten things which have amused/entertained/informed me, and that I think are worth your time reading.

I use it to dump in links which I know will be useful to me in the future, but which aren't in-depth reading. How-to's, tips, that kind of thing, all of which I categorise and tag so they form even more useful collections.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Readwise Reader, on the other hand, is a read-it-later service like Pocket -- but it's the Olympic Gold medal winning version, the Pele and Maradonna and Messi combined into one of reading things. It's perfectly happy ingesting feeds, or emails, or PDFs as well as simple saving articles, and it integrates with Readwise (of course) which I use to funnel all kinds of stuff into my Obsidian notes. It costs money, but it's a service that is well worth it. I would imagine that most of what I write about in <em>Ten Blue Links</em> is going to come from Readwise.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This one has ended up long, but I promise I'll make it shorter next time...</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The ten blue links for this week</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Apple's culture shaped its DMA response</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wrote at length about <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/01/27/some-thoughts-on-apples-response-to-the-eu-dma/\">my feelings over Apple's response to the EU DMA</a> -- childish is the kindest way of putting it -- but I really enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2024/01/29/because-of-their.html\">Manton Reece's short post about it</a>. Manton's focus is Apple's culture, how that has been shaped, and how that has really influenced their response:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because of their decades of truly great products, Apple thinks they are more clever than anyone else. Because of their focus on privacy, Apple thinks they are righteous. Because of their financial success, Apple thinks they are more powerful than governments. The DMA will test whether they’re right.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Return to office = failure of management</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apple, of course, is one of the companies that has mandated its workers return to office -- and they are not alone. But <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/return_to_office_mandates_do_not_boost_profits/\">some new research has found</a> that not only does RTO not improve productivity, and damages worker engagement, it actually stems from a simple need for control from managers. Simply put: bad leadership:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\"Results of our determinant analyses are consistent with managers using RTO mandates to reassert control over employees and blame employees as a scapegoat for bad performance\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Everyone is a sellout now</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The creative industries are having a bad decade. Journalism, in particular, is in a horrible place with jobs lost left, right and centre. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/2/1/24056883/tiktok-self-promotion-artist-career-how-to-build-following\">Rebecca Jennings wrote a great article</a> about how everyone now has to be a pitch person, and how basically if, for example, you're a writer you're now expected to also be able to market your work -- and won't get employment if you don't. And of course, this has a direct, and negative, impact on your actual work:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next thing you know, it’s been three years and you’ve spent almost no time on your art,” he tells me. “You’re getting worse at it, but you’re becoming a great marketer for a product which is less and less good.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Fertile fallacies</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sam Freedman's article on <a href=\"https://samf.substack.com/p/fertile-fallacies-and-policy-bubbles?r=72szy&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\">fertile fallacies and policy bubbles</a> was specifically about politics, but I think it's equally applicable to many areas of life. Sam's point is that sometimes bad ideas work at first, up until the point where they don't. This is because they often have a kernel of truth about them, or are a reaction to something which has pushed too far.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A policy belief that initially began with an important truth – governments need to have control over state spending and some process to maintain it – has ended up distorted into an absurd farce whereby Treasury officials are frantically changing their policy proposals for the Chancellor based on daily fluctuations in projected borrowing for 2029.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But you can apply this idea <em>everywhere.</em> Consider tech: app stores were a reaction to the absolute hell that was mobile apps in the pre-iPhone era, coupled to the opportunity to make something that was a little more secure for users than the PC. This has inflated to the point where you'll find people who genuinely believe that no one should have the right to install software on a device they own, and that developers owe a tithe to whoever made the platform they're using.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. The evolution of the Conservative mind</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a connection here, I think, with Simon Wren-Lewis' piece on <a href=\"https://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2024/01/the-evolution-of-uk-conservative-party.html\">the evolution of the British Conservative party</a> from neoliberalism as economic doctrine to social conservatism which solely acts in the interests of the wealthy. As with the policy fallacies that Freedman focuses on, the central doctrinal fallacy of neoliberalism has inflated into a bubble that goes well beyond its original intent.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the UK, the inflationary force in this bubble was Brexit:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The key moment in this transformation in the UK was of course Brexit. Although it is just about possible to rationalise Brexit in neoliberal terms, if we think about power, Brexit was far from neoliberal. The overwhelming majority of businesses and corporations selling to and from the UK suffered serious damage at the hands of newspaper owners and a few very wealthy individuals. This kind of capture of a neoliberal party by monied interests is not really surprising, because once a politician sees themselves as representing the interests of corporations and businesses generally rather than society, it is a small step to start representing the interests of particular and potentially unrepresentative corporations and businesses (and their ‘think tanks’), especially if those businesses happen to be newspapers or party donors or future employers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/jan/30/uk-perceived-as-more-corrupt-lowest-score-global-index-transparency-international\">Corruption inevitably follows</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, this doesn't explain the similar process that has happened in the US and across the world, but there were, no doubt, similar processes at work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6.

Every company you can think of now, from Apple to Meta to Google and beyond, seems to be hitching its \"growth\" wagon to collecting tithes of one sort or another. It's no longer enough to simply make products and sell them: you have have have ongoing revenue from users to grow.<sup data-fn=\"1a79a958-71e8-46b9-a4fa-d6519eae97f6\" class=\"fn\"><a href=\"#1a79a958-71e8-46b9-a4fa-d6519eae97f6\" id=\"1a79a958-71e8-46b9-a4fa-d6519eae97f6-link\">1</a></sup></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What if we thought of some of the most lucrative tech companies as essentially tax collectors, but privately-run (and thus not democratically accountable)?

It’s basically baked in to their business model. Once you’ve fully developed the technology underpinning your service - be it coordinating food delivery, or processing payments, or displaying intrusive ads to people who just want to read a goddamn page on the Internet without being entreated to buy stuff - then your whole schtick then becomes collecting taxes on a whole ecosystem of economic activity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">9.

I’m on record as believing that a lot of traffic, especially for pages designed to answer specific queries, is going to go away as AI gets better at answering questions. Even for affiliate content, I think the appeal of answers that you can have a conversation with, so you get a completely custom answer to, say, what laptop to buy, will be so high for consumers that publishers will see declines in traffic over the coming years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So then, publishers are facing a few years of transition from old models – where it was possible to get a lot of traffic from terms like “when is the Super Bowl” or “how much is a Ford Fiesta?” — to a future where every single question like that can be answered on the page. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Knowing this, there is no point in setting a strategy for the coming year which doesn’t take account of this longer-term trend.

I follow a fairly standard intent-based split into four buckets:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>\n<strong>Informational: </strong>Getting specific answers, usually starting with how/why/whats and commonly answered with some kinds of tutorial</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>\n<strong>Commercial: </strong>Usually showing some kind of purchase intent, at either early or late stages in the funnel. Almost always including bests, comparisons, reviews, product categories or product/service names. Best answered by reviews and comparisons, and, of course, the heart of affiliate revenue.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>\n<strong>Transactional:</strong> All about completing the immediate action of purchase.

That’s good news if you’re looking to affiliate content to drive your revenue over the next year or so, but it also means that informational queries are both dropping in volume <strong>and</strong> will be answered more on the page through AI-driven features like Search Generative Experience (SGE). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For entertainment brands that have come to rely on informational content about, say, Love Island and have no authority at all about products, this could lead to a particularly bad short-term squeeze. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The temptation will be to try to turn entertainment brands into product focused ones, but it’s worth not going overboard with this, as over the long term it could dilute authority in other areas.

This had the double whammy of both getting you traffic, and weakening your competition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I told you it was dirty, didn’t I?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The problem with this was that combined with headings targeting related keywords, everyone ended up with content which was highly optimised but unoriginal. It all looked, and often read, the same.

That doesn’t mean abandoning the basics of on-page SEO, or never looking at your rivals for ideas. But it means that if your rival is taking an approach, thinking of an original way to answer the same need for the audience will help you stand out. And in a world of AI-generated <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/01/24/the-information-grey-goo/\">grey goo content</a>, you will need to stand out. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How do you do that? Well, that is a creative question for you to answer – and <a href=\"https://pressgazette.co.uk/news/reach-redundancies-social-media-influencers-deny-ceo-jim-mullen/\">you do still have some creative journalists left in the building, right?</a> My personal favourite is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23642073/best-printer-2023-brother-laser-wi-fi-its-fine\">The Verge’s magnificent pastiche of an affiliate article</a>, but your mileage may vary – and more importantly, the things which make your audience laugh, cry, and so on are areas that only your experts can tell you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Roland Barthes would have been a terrible SEO</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second area is our old friend authorship because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author\">far from being dead</a>, the author is back at the centre of the universe. Unless you have been hiding under a rock, you will already have good quality author pages which link to every single article from your author. You will also have purged your sites of those dreadful “Brand Byline” things which indicate either a confused content strategy or content with quality so low that no one wants to put their name on it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now it’s time to go deeper, and that will mean using any means necessary to establish the authority of authors. Make sure that your authors are “out there” – no, not wearing tie-dye clothes and going to Grateful Dead gigs, I mean getting as many authoritative mentions on media you don’t own as possible. Guesting on podcasts, writing guest posts, being quoted by news organisations – encourage your authors to have and raise a professional profile. If one of your journalists is the go-to expert about a topic area, that will pay off over the long term in increases weight of their authority by Google, and the sum of their authority is your authority as a brand. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is no on-page or technical SEO fix for this. If your journalists spend all their time in the office churning out “me too” articles and never actually doing any work to raise their profile, they are never going to have enough authority.

Yes, that’s right, some people write reviews having never had the products in their hands. What, you think PRs are actually sending out products to hundreds and hundreds of big and small publishers for test? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was a good argument for this: doing reviews based on desk research was a time-saver. Rather than consumers having to comb through spec sheets and a thousand user reviews on Amazon, one journalist could do it well and get a better result, with the application of their expertise. But… it was always a bit of a cop-out, at least for major publishers who could get the real thing in for review.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the era of experience, desk research is dead. You need to write from first-hand experience of the product, and you need to demonstrate it as often as you can in the copy. You are using first-person, right?

More focused on the idea that not only is wanting this stupid, but that it's somehow a threat to other people's security.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And as we all know, when people feel their security is threatened, they act a little weird. <a href=\"https://www.simplypsychology.org/folk-devils-and-moral-panics-cohen-1972.html#:~:text=Moral%20panic%20is%20a%20situation,to%20public%20standards%20of%20behavior.\">Moral panics, and all that</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then I remember another characteristic of feudalism: many people are most comfortable when there is a feudal lord to protect them and make decisions for them, and so vociferously attack when anyone suggests that, perhaps, the existing social order needs to change.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's not simply because <a href=\"https://imgur.com/gallery/MVA446a\">they long for the attention of the rich and powerful</a> and see protecting them as a way to gain favour. Feudalism survived by ensuring that the peasants were always helpless, always in need of protection, and of course always threatened. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchy\">The lord protected you from anarchy</a>. Unable to imagine another world being possible, the peasant can only support the lords' right to rule because to do otherwise would mean either a more cruel lord, or dangerous lawlessness.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As we move into <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/28/cloudalists/\">technofeudalism</a>, where instead of owning technology we rent it, those old peasant instincts are resurfacing. There is a big, bad world out there of hackers, thieves, scammers, and other ne'er-do-wells, and only feudal lord Apple can protect us from it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\"But You have to protect people\"</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have some sympathy for the argument that people require protecting. We still get, on a weekly basis, scam calls on our landline from people claiming to be from Microsoft, wanting to “sell” my now-departed in-laws protection for their PC. My father-in-law had dementia, used a computer, and managed to sign up to every kind of dubious data gathering exercise known to man. We are on many lists. I have become very used to calmly asking the person at the other end of the line whether their parents know they attempt to steal old, vulnerable peoples' savings for a living.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having protections available is a good thing. Having them as the default on very widely used devices like smartphones is also a good thing. But having no ability to turn them off, no matter what? Not so good.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having protections doesn't mean everyone has to use them. Those who want to opt-out should be able to do so. No one is suggesting that the App Store should be closed down, and anyone who wants to be protected by Apple should be able to carry on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But then there's the protection argument again. If it can be turned off, the argument goes, then bad people will persuade the vulnerable to do just that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of which is a good argument for “parental control” systems, which allow the vulnerable to be protected by someone they know, but not a good argument unless you believe that <strong>everyone</strong> out there is stupid and needs feudal lord Apple to protect them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ah.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm not going to link to the original post or put a name on it because I know the person who wrote it means well, and they are by no means the only one making much the same argument:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I get what you’re saying and that’s fine for nerds, but the average punter isn’t able to decide that, is terrified of tech, and doesn’t even know what software is.

Among other things, in the iOS ecosystem users are obliged to get all their software from Apple’s store, and developers are obliged to sell it in the company store. This may be Apple’s definition of personal computing, but it’s not mine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the time, I shrugged off Dan's arguments. Wasn't there room for a powerful computer, but incredibly easy to use? Where there was never going to be a worry about malware? I think I saw the iPad as just a tiny step on from the Mac: the <strong>real</strong> computer for the rest of us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was wrong. Dan was right. As was <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.5555/1464251.1464256\">Cory Doctorow in 2006</a>. As was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060805102033/http://diveintomark.org/archives/2006/06/02/when-the-bough-breaks\">Mark Pilgrim the same year</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apple isn't a bunch of evil geniuses wanting to rule the world. Ultimately, Apple is driven by the same forces as every public company: the demand from “the market” for continual growth. As anyone with a passing interesting in compound growth will tell you, that becomes significantly harder as a company gets bigger. For Apple, 10% revenue growth in 2004 meant adding just $800 million. By 2014, that required an additional $18 billion. In 2024, that will require $38 billion.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are no more devices as big as the iPhone to be launched, no more hardware markets worth tens of billions of dollars which Apple can magic into existence to keep their share price growing (and no, Apple Vision Pro is not it). So the only way of keeping that revenue growth rolling is to squeeze more from customers, and to ensure that not one cent of current revenue slips from the feudal lord's fingers. And that includes the tens of billions of dollars of revenue it makes from the App Store.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only way for Apple to keep growing is to not only retain the control — and thus revenue — it has, but to tighten the screws and get more control. To ensure you <em>can't</em> buy an iPhone without also paying them a monthly tithe for storing photos. To ensure that <em>no application gets sold</em> without Apple getting a cut. The role of the feudal lord is one that Apple is choosing to play because it makes more money that way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Turning points…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have never been one to entirely excuse Apple its control-freakery, but I've also respected them and liked the products they make. I'm started writing this on an M2 MacBook Air, and it's the best laptop I have ever owned in many ways, not least the battery life. Without Apple's determination to do its own thing, to \"<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/03/20/out-apple-apple\">own the whole widget</a>\" as Steve Jobs would have said, that battery life wouldn't be possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But: <em>the Mac model of (relative) openness is not the one which Apple has chosen to pursue.</em> Instead, its focus is on keeping things closed, reducing developers to digital serfs paying a tithe to the feudal lord whose land they are allowed to plough. And of course, ensuring that its customers, who pay a handsome margin to the company simply to buy its products, <a href=\"https://repair.eu/news/apples-self-repair-programme-is-not-the-right-to-repair-we-need/\">cannot choose what they do with those expensive devices</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just as the release of the iPad Pro was a turning point for Dan Gillmor, Apple's response to the Digital Services Act feels like one for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I started writing this on the MacBook Air, but I'm finishing it on a ThinkPad X1 Carbon running Fedora 39 Linux. I'm using the same tools to write on both: Obsidian, configured just how I like it, even down to using LanguageTool to proof it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The MacBook Air will almost certainly be the last Apple product I buy. When the time comes to replace my iPhone, maybe towards the back end of this year, I'll look for something I can install a de-Googled version of Android on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been playing with a Pixel 6 running Graphene, which even lets you install Google's apps on it, but restricts them and prevents them from doing the full range of spying on you. I like that idea: taking a dangerous but handsome animal, and ensuring you can admire its beauty while stopping it biting you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps one day Apple might let me do the same with the device I paid them a thousand pounds for. But I'm not going to hold my breath.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And no, I am not switching fealty from the Apple feudal lord to the Google one.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Without the Mac, I wouldn’t have had a career.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first time I encountered a Mac was in 1986. As a fresh-faced know-it-all Humanities student, I had use of the computer lab at Hatfield Polytechnic. Although I (like everyone) had an account on the VMS computer, I was much more drawn to the ten or so strange boxy all-in-one computers arranged against one wall.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Mac, so my computer scientist hall mates told me, was something pretty special. They were also the people who, once I requested and got an account on the college Unix machine, thought it was hilarious to hack it and give me root access— but that’s another story.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over the next couple of years, the Mac and me became firm friends. I can still do a pretty good impersonation of the sound that the floppy drive made when you ejected a disk. You heard that a lot because the computer had a single drive and so you spent a lot of time swapping disks around. I remember getting a pirated copy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WriteNow\">WriteNow</a> when it was released, and how amazingly fast it was compared to MacWrite.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I graduated in 1989, I already knew I would be going back to do a PhD, but spent a year working at Apple in Information Systems and Technology, AKA IS&amp;T, as a desktop support assistant. This was possibly the easiest technical job in the world because around 95% of all problems could be resolved in one of two ways: reinstalling the system, or replacing the motherboard. And as the spares warehouse was downstairs, motherboards were not in short supply. I have no idea what the stock control system was, but I never encountered it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I could write a whole article about that year. About the fantastic community of nerds that you could tap into via AppleLink, the internal email system and proto-internet which also linked Apple to its dealers, and which ultimately became America Online. About dropping the only Mac Portable in the UK from a height of around two metres while the hard drive was spinning – and it surviving without a scratch (that machine was <em>tough</em>). About having an alpha release of System 7, which was still known as <em>Blue</em>, and installing it on a machine just to see what it looked like (slow, buggy and disappointing was the answer).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the most important thing about that year was that it gave my my first Mac: a Mac Plus, with a 20Mb external hard drive, a second 20Mb external SCSI drive, and an ImageWriter II printer. I (ahem) “borrowed” some extra SIMMs to take it up to the full 4Mb of memory, and wrote half a thesis on that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other half got written on my next Mac: an LC 475 AKA Performa 475 AKA Quadra 605. By that point, I was teaching as well as studying, and the extra money I made paid for a much-needed new Mac. The Mac Plus, which was eight years old, really wasn’t keeping up with my wide range of pirated software. Most importantly, it couldn’t play Arkanoid in colour.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By the end of that year I needed a job, and like every Humanities graduate, I looked to the Wednesday edition of <em>The Guardian</em> to provide. That was when the media jobs were advertised, and I applied for a job on <em>MacUser</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I knew nothing about journalism — I had never aspired to be one, and it probably took me another two years before I could describe myself as one without embarrassment. Given that my job mostly involved calling PRs to get equipment to test in the labs, unboxing said equipment, and working with a succession of real journalists to devise ever more fiendish ways to prove that Printer X was better than Printer Y, my reluctance was probably justified.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Six years later, I was editing the magazine. A title so profitable that it built Felix Dennis several houses, and provided the money to launch <em>Maxim</em>, which took Felix from “rich” to “seriously rich” when he sold it. I have a story about the sale of Maxim in the US which is funny, full of swearing, shows how much luck Felix had, and is completely unrepeatable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being editor of <em>MacUser</em> was serious. You got invited to a ludicrous number of swanky events, got to be a D&amp;AD judge, and won many awards. Apple was on its uppers, but <em>MacUser</em> was thriving. I sometimes think that the better <em>MacUser</em> did the worse Apple went, and certainly Apple’s revival under Steve Jobs coincided with the slow demise of the Mac titles. I don’t think it was his fault: at that point, this weird internet thing was beginning to gut advertising revenues. But you never know…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since I left <em>MacUser</em> I’ve worked for other magazines, other publishers, clients and friends on brands as diverse as The Week, Grazia, heat (yes, it is lower case) and Motorcycle News. I made a brief return to full-time tech journalism at Dennis in the mid ‘10s, and had another ball, but technology journalism has moved on a lot and I don’t think it’s as much fun as it was (the parties… well, they’re not as spectacular. One day, I’ll write up the story of the launch of A Very Major Product which… let’s draw a curtain over that).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But: without the Mac, without that odd little box I encountered in a computer lab in 1986, I wouldn’t have had the career I have had. Who knows what I would have done? Most of my friends spent a chunk of the 90s working in record shops, while I was getting flown around the world. And I don’t think I had their level of ambition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, thanks, Apple. Thanks for my career.

I doubt that’s likely. But one consequence which I can see use sleepwalking into is the informational equivalent of an apocalypse that dates back over thirty years: the “grey goo” scenario.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“Grey goo” was a concept which emerged when nanotechnology was the hot new thing. First put forward by Eric Drexler in his 1986 book <em>The Engines of Creation,</em> this is the idea that self-replicating nanobots could go out of control and consume all the resources on Earth, turning everything into a grey mass of nanomachines. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Few people worry about a nanotech apocalypse now, but arguably we should be worried about AI having a very similar effect on the internet. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nowhere is safe</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unless you haven’t been paying attention, you will have noticed that the amount of content created by LLMs has been increasing at a vast rate. No one knows how much content is being generated, but SEOs – whose job it is to understand content on the internet – <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/googles-shifting-approach-ai-content-435601\">are concerned</a>. Less ethical SEOs have used <a href=\"https://medium.com/@abhishek2ndline/inside-the-first-seo-heist-of-the-ai-era-7e4cf235766c\">a combination of scraping and generative A</a>I to quickly create low-quality sites with tens of thousands of pages on them, reaping rewards in traffic from Google over the short term. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The problem for Google is that creating a site like that is the work of perhaps a week – and probably a lot less if it can be automated – while it takes months for the search engine to spot that it’s a low-quality site. With more automated approaches, it will become trivial to create spammy sites far faster than Google can combat them. It’s like a game of whack-a-mole, where there are moles appearing at an exponential rate. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And Google isn’t the only platform which AI is threatening to turn to mush. Amazon has <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-65881800\">a issue with fake reviews generated by AI</a>. And although it claims <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/tech/amazon-fake-reviews-artificial-intelligence-b1087465.html\">it is working on solutions</a>, it appears to be incapable of even spotting <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/01/lazy-use-of-ai-leads-to-amazon-products-called-i-cannot-fulfill-that-request/\">fake AI-generated product names</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But what about human-to-human social networks? They have already been <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@parkermolloy/post/C14qS_CJp8q\">flooded with AI-generated responses</a>. And it will only get worse, as companies create tools which let brands <a href=\"https://replyguy.com/\">automatically respond to posts based on keywords using AI-generated text</a>. Sooner or later, saying something which suggests you are in the market for a new car will get you spammed by responses from Ford, Skoda, VW, Tesla, every car dealer in your area, every private second hand seller… you get the picture. Good luck trying to find the real people. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is obvious that <strong>anywhere content can be created will ultimately be flooded with AI-generated words and pictures</strong>. And the pace of this could accelerate over the coming years, as the tools to use LLMs programmatically become more complex. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, think about reviews on Amazon. It will be possible to create a programme which says “Find all my products on Amazon. Where the product rating drops below 5, add unique AI-generated reviews until the rating reaches 5 again. Continue monitoring this and adding reviews.” </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We are already at the point where you can use natural language to create specialist GPTs. The ability to create these kinds of programmes is ultimately going to in the hands of everyone. And this applies to every rating system, all surveys, all polls, all user reviews – and similar approaches can be created for any kind of content. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Can Google, Amazon and the rest fight back? Yes – but at great cost. And it’s not clear that even the likes of Google has the resources to effectively fight millions of users of AI creating billions of low-quality pages at an accelerating scale.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Model collapse</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A side-by-side comparison of content created from the same prompt in ChatGPT 3 versus ChatGPT 4 Turbo will show you the difference. And humans are getting better at writing prompts and giving AI models the information they need to do a better job. So surely, this is just a short-term problem, and AI content will get “good enough” to not flood the internet with crap.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The issue is that there is a counterbalancing force at play. As more and more AI-generated content floods the public internet, more and more of that content will end up as training data for AI. Exacerbating this, quality publications are <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/most-news-sites-block-ai-bots-right-wing-media-welcomes-them/\">largely blocking AI bots</a>, for <a href=\"https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/openai-says-its-in-talks-with-dozens-of-publishers-about-licensing-content,247478\">entirely understandable reasons</a>, which means less, and less higher-quality content is being used to train the next generation of models.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, researchers have noted that the  LAION-5B dataset, used to train Stable Diffusion and many other models, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01850.pdf\">already contains synthetic images created by earlier AI models</a>. This is the equivalent of a child learning to draw solely by copying the images made by younger children – not a scenario which is likely to improve quality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, researchers already have a name for the inevitable bad outcome: “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17493\">model collapse</a>”. In this case, the content generated by AI’s stops improving, and starts to get worse. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Information Grey Goo</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is the AI Grey Goo scenario: an internet choked with low-quality content, which never improves, where it is almost impossible to locate public reliable sources for information because the tools we have been able to rely on in the past – Google, social media – can never keep up with the scale of new content being created. Where <strong>the volume of content created overwhelms human or algorithmic abilities to sift through it quickly and find high-quality stuff.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The social and political consequences of this are huge.

Now that Microsoft has started to roll out Copilot for Microsoft 365 to all sizes of business, it's likely that more and more will turn it on (at $30 a licence) and think that's their \"AI stuff\" sorted. And then, of course, lay off 10% of the workforce because what their spreadsheet reckons is the \"efficiency gain\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That, of course, is bunk. Using AI in your business is about people, and how you train them, and it demands a<a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/01/18/ai-is-about-people-not-just-machines/\"> change from a \"one and done\" training approach to a continuous structure learning system</a> – something that's not easy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also wrote a related piece about <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/01/19/how-to-roll-out-ai-in-a-creative-business/\">using the ADKAR change management framework to roll out AI</a>. The point that I wanted to get across was that you are committing to a major strategic change, and you need to do that formally – and manage it, rather than just imposing it on teams. ADKAR is great for that, and, as I note, if you do it well it's not actually going to be cheap because you need potentially new roles to implement ongoing optimisation of the way you work with AI. Interesting times: it reminds me of the early days of the web.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things I have been reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I finished off Neal Asher's <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jenny-Trapdoor-Neal-Asher-ebook/dp/B0CQRBPR5H/ref=sr_1_1?crid=226CV93BK57QM&amp;keywords=jenny+trapdoor+neal+asher&amp;qid=1705854572&amp;sprefix=Jenny+Trap%2Caps%2C158&amp;sr=8-1\">Jenny Trapdoor</a></em>, which was… OK.

I felt in places like it was a cosmology lecture masquerading as a novel, there were aspects of it which made no sense at all from a plot perspective, and had I been editing it I would have wanted some of it to just get dropped. It felt, at the end, like Baxter had created an interesting backdrop for a story but not really put much of a story into it. Which, as I said, is very Baxter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Who are the people who are at the centre of many things, who act as communicators? Who do other employees go to for help and advice? Are there people who, when a new project starts, are the first names on the list? They are not always senior, so make sure you’re looking across the board for your champions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even if they are not the most senior people or the most engaged with AI at this point, if you win them over and make them part of the project, you will reap the benefits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember, too, that desire is personal to everyone. While making the business more efficient and profitable tends to get your senior team grinning, not everyone in your business is motivated by that. Focus, too, on the benefits for people’s careers, work/life balance, and especially with AI, freeing up time to do more creative things and less routine work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And don’t, whatever you do, talk about how “if we don’t become more efficient, people will lose their jobs”. I’ve seen this approach taken many times, and in creative businesses, it almost never works. Desire is about motivating people to change, and fear is a bad motivator.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key elements of building desire for AI:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Inspire and engage your team members to participate in the AI adoption process.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Identify and involve key influencers and champions who can advocate for AI and influence others.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Highlight the personal and professional advantages of AI, such as learning new skills, increasing productivity, or advancing career opportunities.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a sense of urgency and excitement around AI and its potential.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Knowledge</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If awareness is about the why, the knowledge stage is about the how: <em>how are we going to use these tools?</em> This is where you build knowledge of the tools <em>and</em> the processes by which you use them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One mistake that I have seen made – OK, to be honest, I <em>have</em> made – is to focus too heavily on training people on how to use a tool, without also training on changes in the processes you’re expecting people to make. Every new tool, including AI, comes with processes changes. And, in fact, the process changes that the tool enables are where you achieve the biggest benefits.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Training people in the context of the processes they follow (and any associated changes) relates the training to what people do – and that’s why I would recommend role-based training, which may cut across teams. If you have large teams, consider further segmenting this according to levels of experience. But I would recommend that you train everyone if possible: people who are left out may end up feeling either that AI isn’t relevant to them (and it will be) or that they have no future in your new, AI-enabled business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key elements of building knowledge of AI:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Provide adequate and relevant training and resources for your team members to learn about AI and how to use it effectively.

This stage is where the rubber really hits the road because it’s where all that training starts to be implemented. And at this point, people will start to spot issues they didn't see before as they get the hang of new processes and get better at them. They will also find things you didn’t anticipate, and even <em>better ways of using AI.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One aspect that’s critical at this stage is the generation of short-term wins. For a lot of your teams, AI is the proverbial big scary thing which is going to cost them their jobs – and even if you have had a successful “desire” phase, it can be easy for people to be knocked off course when that is at the back of their minds, or they are reading scare stories about how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/07/five-ways-ai-might-destroy-the-world-everyone-on-earth-could-fall-over-dead-in-the-same-second\">AI will mean the end of humanity</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quick wins will help with this. They are positive, visible evidence about the success of people they know using AI, and in storytelling terms that is absolute gold dust. Remember, though, that the positives must be personal, and in a creative business they need to focus on improving the creative work. Shaving 10% of the time taken from a boring business process might be incredibly valuable to you, but it’s not all that compelling to a writer, editor, or video producer.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key elements of building ability in AI:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Support your team members to apply their AI knowledge and skills in their daily work.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Create a safe and supportive environment where they can experiment, practice, and learn from mistakes.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Provide guidance, feedback, and recognition to reinforce positive behaviours and outcomes.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Make sure success stories are being shared, and that your teams are helping each other.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Monitor and track performance and results to ensure quality and consistency.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reinforcement</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This stage focuses on activities that help make a change stick and prevent individuals from reverting to old habits or behaviours, and I think it’s both the most crucial stage of managing a change in technology or process – and the one that’s easily forgotten.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are several reasons for this. First, commitment even among your senior team may be waning, leading to reduced encouragement from the top to continue along the path. The people who thought that your rollout of AI was likely to fail will probably be latching on to every bump in the road and turning them into roadblocks – ones that they “knew would happen”.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is why it’s incredibly important to have <em>all</em> your senior team go through a parallel managed change process, to make sure they are all bought into what you want to achieve. AI is a strategic change on the same level of impact long-term as a complete restructure of your entire business, so there is no getting round managing that process for your senior team.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are starting to get resistance to AI deployment at this stage, check whether your senior team are still bought into it. In the worst case, some of them may be sending subconscious signals to their teams that they don’t have to keep going.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And now the bad news: in terms of budget, the reinforcement phase may cost as much as the training required in the knowledge phase because you need people looking after the AI roll out who are constantly engaging with your teams, understanding issues, celebrating success, and making sure that communications about how AI works for everyone, and – importantly – keeps everyone updated on new developments and changes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For every new pitch, product or process, someone needs to be in the room asking how you can use AI to improve this, speed it up, or do interesting creative things. That is the only way they AI will become embedded in what you do, and not fade away – as so many corporate projects do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Who is that person going to be? The likelihood is that in the “desire” phase, internal champions will emerge who can do that job. This offers the advantage of credibility, as it’s someone who is both personally familiar and professionally respected, but don’t make the mistake of assuming this role is something that you can tack on to a day job. Unless your business is very small, doing all this is a full-time role, for at least a year after you have “completed” the rollout of the technology.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key elements of reinforcing AI use:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Celebrate and reward your team members for their achievements and contributions to the AI adoption process.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Focus on improvements in employees’ experience, not just business benefits.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Solicit and act on feedback to improve and refine your AI practices and policies.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Reinforce the benefits and value of AI for your business and your team.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Keep your team informed and updated on the latest AI trends and developments and encourage continuous learning and improvement.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n",

And that highlights something that I suspect is getting neglected: long-term training and support for users in businesses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing I have noticed in the creative industries time and again: technology often gets side-lined in learning and development. Sure, publishing companies have massively improved when it comes to fostering skills in leadership, coaching and other business areas. Yet, when it comes to embracing and learning new tech, training tends to be pretty old-fashioned, rolled out in a “one and done” approach. Updates are relegated to the odd email (which no one reads). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the old days, that worked because the pace of change of technology was comparatively slow. A new version of QuarkXpress (yes I am that old) would come out every couple of years, you would do an update session and that was it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But for cloud technologies this is not enough, and when there is a complete paradigm shift in tech – as we’re experiencing with AI – it risks putting you well behind more agile businesses.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.oliverwymanforum.com/global-consumer-sentiment/how-will-ai-affect-global-economics.html\">a report by Oliver Wyman Forum</a>, there is a significant gap between the skills employees believe they need training in, such as AI and big data, creative thinking, and leadership, and the training that employers are currently offering. 57% of employees think the training they are getting isn’t sufficient. And I think they’re right. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, you can implement short-term fixes. But this is also a good opportunity to set up the way you train and the way your people learn for the long term. The next three to five years are going to see the pace of change accelerate, and you need to adapt the systems which allow your people to learn.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Continuous structured learning</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Integrating AI tools into your team's workflow isn't a one-time event, but rather a journey of continuous learning. Begin by setting up a framework for ongoing training and support. This could mean setting up regular training sessions to providing access to online courses, interactive tutorials, and detailed manuals. It's not just about the initial learning curve; it's about keeping the knowledge fresh and relevant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To foster a culture of continuous learning, encourage your team to see AI as an evolving toolset, one that offers new opportunities for growth and innovation. Promote an environment where experimentation is the norm, and learning from mistakes is valued. This approach helps to maintain a level of curiosity and enthusiasm for what AI can bring to the table.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember, the key to continuous learning is collaboration and knowledge sharing. By encouraging your team members to share their experiences and insights gained from using AI tools, you create a knowledge-rich environment. Regular team discussions, workshops, or even informal chat sessions can be great platforms for this exchange of ideas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not everyone is going to want to get on board. To get tech-hesitant people excited about AI, relate it to their interests and show how it simplifies work or hobbies. Demystify AI with jargon-free explanations and introduce them to easy-to-use tools through hands-on sessions. Sharing success stories of others who've overcome similar fears can motivate them. Ensure support is available for any questions, making their AI journey smooth and approachable, while focusing on its practical, real-world applications.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To put this into action, consider scheduling a monthly 'AI day' where team members can share new findings, discuss challenges, and brainstorm on how to better integrate AI into your workflows. Think about establishing a mentorship program where more experienced team members can guide others through learning about AI. And finally, make sure you are making use of your best communicators, not just the people who are really enthusiastic about AI.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

According to a survey by ResumeBuilder, <a href=\"https://www.resumebuilder.com/90-of-companies-will-return-to-office-by-the-end-of-2024/\">90% of employers plan to return to office by the end of 2024</a>. Over a quarter of them intend to threaten employees who don’t want to return to office with being fired.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But return to office hasn’t been plain sailing. The latest company to come a cropper with its plans is Internet Brands, the parent company of WebMD, which <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@jordanreviewsittt/post/C1_KIWIOYYy\">created a video “encouraging” its teams back into the office</a>, ending in a screen – and I am not making this up – which notes “we mean business” and “don’t mess with us”.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cue much hilarity from the internet. Internet Brands is probably lucky that Twitter isn’t the force it once was because the pre-Musk social network would have run with this one for several weeks. Now, it’ll get buried under an avalanche of rubbish on Threads after a couple of days, or be seen by the couple of million users on Bluesky.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I digress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many arguments over the effectiveness of remote working vs in-office, some good and some bad. Having a separation between home and work is a good thing, for one, and although older employees tend to have plenty of space to make that work, younger ones in shared accommodation or living with parents often don’t. And younger employees also benefit from working closely with colleagues, who can mentor them informally much more easily when physically present.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think this is particularly true for the creative industries. Creative people typically like to think of themselves as the definitive solo fliers, coming up with great ideas and then hammering them into shape, before having them ruined by an editor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the reality is that creative work is always collaborative. For example, in digital publishing, your content teams and audience development people need to mesh and work as one team; otherwise they can make the human equivalent of the sound gears make when grinding against each other.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that is why broad directives about the amount of time which people spend face-to-face vs remote are damaging not only to the people involved, who inevitably feel robbed of autonomy and disempowered, but also to a creative business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To find the most workable approach, leaders should focus on four factors: the needs of the work, the needs of the people, how work gets done, and the new managerial muscle required to manage a hybrid workforce.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Broad, uniform directives can only be effective if all work is identical and performed by a uniform workforce, which is not the case in the creative industries, and not true for most others. Rather than imposing directives, CEOs should empower their managers, particularly those at the front line, to develop a comprehensive understanding of their team's work, the working styles of their team members, and the most effective ways to accomplish their tasks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course that depends on having empowered, well-trained leadership down to the small team level – but you are already doing that, aren’t you?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It was not the greatest of years of my life. In fact, I would put it down as probably the worst, all things considered. Even lockdown, with all its attendent insanity, had good moments. 2023 really doesn’t feel like it had many.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first week of the year is always an odd when when you’re working for a company. It’s a time when quite a few people are going to be away, taking the chance of an extended break (if you time it well, you can basically get three to four weeks off).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s a little different when you’re not working. The danger is there is no “first week back” in the same way there’s no “last week”. The time can all blur into one miasma of semi-productive, semi-unproductive days. Which then turn into weeks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Similarly the division between weekdays and weekends becomes something you have to actively preserve, rather than simply relying on a lack of work to magically create your weekend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And it’s fair to say this week saw a slow start. But towards the end of the week, things picked up. I worked through what I wanted my goals to be for this quarter (and in fact this year). I also started testing <a href=\"https://www.usemotion.com/\">Motion</a>, which is an interesting task/calendar app which I like the look of.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What Motion does is automatically create blocks of time for your tasks. You prioritise them, put in deadlines and start dates, and an estimate of how long it will take to do the task. For bigger tasks which take longer than an hour, you can define “blocks” – the shortest block of time that you want to work on that task. Motion then goes off and puts the blocks on your calendar, effectively scheduling in all the work that you have to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It sounds more complex than it it, but the end result is pretty compelling: a complete schedule which lets you be clear at all times about what’s next. I started working with it at the end of the week and absolutely blasted through a bunch of stuff which had been lingering on my task list for ages.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Motion started off life as a calendar application and it still works well as one. It will connect to Google, iCloud and Microsoft (work and personal) calendars, and arranges your tasks around meetings. If a new meeting drops in, it will reschedule your tasks, and alert you if suddenly a task becomes impossible to do beyond its deadline.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s not cheap: $19 a month if you pay annually, or a stupid $34 a month if you go monthly, I probably won’t subscribe at this point, as I need to watch where my money is going, but I would definitely be tempted in the future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

On one hand, it opens the opportunity of a REALLY BIG PRESENT as a joint Christmas and birthday one, and one I can open a few days before everyone else gets theirs. Although as a child, there were always a few aunties and uncles who managed to sneak in the same present they would have bought me for Christmas anyway.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, it’s always meant that my birthday was overshadowed by the big day itself. In my teens and early 20s, this didn’t matter: my birthday was just an excuse for friends to start the Christmas week’s drinking early.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But as friends and family got older, my birthday has always tended to get forgotten, or pushed to one side. Happily, that has coincided with getting old enough that each passing year is treated with as much suspicion as optimism. Your best days might be ahead of you, but there is a hell of a lot less of them than you would like.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting old also means that the old acquisitive urges lessen, too, making present buying for me difficult and less obvious. Kim chose wisely, of course, because she puts a great deal of thought into it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hence, spending my birthday evening somewhere near Stratford, seeing <em>ABBA Voyage</em>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve always loved Abba. Old enough to remember when their singles were new and much-anticipated, even as a child I loved the melancholy in their songs. Abba have two modes: full on joy (<em>Dancing Queen</em>) or heartbreak (<em>Knowing me, Knowing you</em>). No band in the world has ever managed to hit both modes so well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve argued in the past that Abba’s greatest hits are better than The Beatles, and I still think that’s true. There’s something to be written about how Abba are queer in a way that The Beatles never could be. But that’s another essay, and one that I am probably not entirely qualified to write.  </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, <em>Voyage</em> is holograms: but after about five minutes, you stop thinking about that and just enjoy it. And it’s wonderful: genuinely the best “live” show I’ve seen. It might have made hundreds of millions of pounds, but you can see where the money went to set it up. Even the building was built specially for the show.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I cried. It’s a mark of the breadth of music that I like that the last band I saw live that made me cry was Van Der Graaf Generator, when they reformed in 2005, and I went to their first show.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But perhaps there’s a connection. I cried at VDGG because they were a band I had loved, who I never thought I would have the chance to see. Abba, despite the physical absence of the protagonists, felt in some way the same.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, if you get a chance, go and see it.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s quite ironic that I spend part of my professional life warning publishers and content creators about platform risk while publishing a newsletter on Substack.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Platform risk can be summed up as the exposure you have to the whims and decisions of platforms on which your business depends. The example that I use a lot is Google: when your revenue depends on mass scale traffic from Google’s organic search results, changes in the algorithm can wipe you out overnight.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But there are other platform risks too. Twitter is a good example of this. For years, journalists and publishers cultivated their individual and brand presences on the social network, not because it delivered huge amounts of traffic (it was low single digits for many brands) but because it was a good place to establish a brand. It was disproportionately used by media people, and so had significant second order effects: you got the attention of people who could bring you more attention via other channels.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That and, as I always say, journalists are gossipy little creatures and Twitter was the world’s biggest journo watercooler. Your audience might not have been on there, but your friends and rivals were.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s why Twitter’s implosion under Elon “don’t give them their money back” Musk is so painful for many in media. A lot of independent creators, in particular, have been caught between not wanting anything to do with a platform where abuse of various kinds is encouraged rather than just tolerated, and wanting to protect their livelihood, which depends on connections on Twitter.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Which leads me on to Substack, and the overnight response of its executives to a letter from over 200 users of the service asking it not to host content by Nazis. There were many possible communications approaches the Substack execs could have taken. They appear to have chosen the worst of all worlds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m not going to go into too much detail about why their response is bunk. <a href=\"https://popehat.substack.com/p/substack-has-a-nazi-opportunity\">Ken White has a good summary</a>, and <a href=\"https://pxlnv.com/linklog/mouse-poop-in-cereal-boxes/\">Nick Heer also has a good take</a>. I will, though, note that Substack’s attempt to portray itself as a “haven for free speech” means “speech we decide is acceptable”: the platform does not allow porn, which is protected free speech in the US. Clearly the company is applying its values to decisions about what to host. Porn is bad, but Nazis – actual, real, Nazis – are fine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Substack is allowed to apply its values to its business. But that also applies to individuals. Freedom of association is as foundational a right as free speech. In fact, arguably, more so. Without freedom of association, freedom of speech is (literally) so much hot air.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, it applies to me too. And one of my core values, really quite a simple one, is not contributing to giving a platform to racists and fascists. Literal Nazis definitely fall into that bucket. By being here, even with a small audience, I am saying I am OK with platforming Nazis.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am not, for the avoidance of doubt, OK with platforming Nazis. And I don’t want to do business with those that are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as of some point between Christmas and New Year – the traditional period for changing tech – I’ll be moving my Substack and mailing list to Wordpress.com, which I already use to host this site. WordPress has features for mailing lists, including paid subscriptions, and it’s easy to move your email addresses over there. Of course, I need to work out how to migrate existing content too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re currently a free subscriber on Substack, this will be almost completely seamless, except you won’t be able to automatically read my posts in the Substack app (no great loss, in my opinion, but your mileage may vary). You will, though, be able to subscribe via RSS in the Substack app if you really want to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re an annual paid Subscriber, you’ll be comped a full year starting in January. If you’re a monthly subscriber, you’ll be comped three months (if I can do it – I need to check if that’s possible, but I’ll work something out). As a reminder at present there are no additional benefits to anyone who pays, but I really appreciate that you do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ironically, WordPress charges me less of a cut than Substack, because I already host my site there. But if you want to move your own Substack and don’t want to pay a monthly fee, you can do that too – the free plan includes paid emails, at the same rate as Substack.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This move should happen before the new year, and I’ll keep subscribers updated about my progress and any snags I hit along the way. Then, at some point around the middle of January, I will be deleting my Substack, and my account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, if you disagree with this decision or aren’t comfortable with WordPress.com, <strong>please do unsubscribe!</strong> Your freedom of association is as important as mine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of Apple’s most annoying habits is changing things to make them harder for users to “make mistakes”. Almost without exception, these actually degrade the user experience in one way or another.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A case in point is the changes that Apple made a while ago to how third-party cloud storage providers such as Dropbox, OneDrive, and Proton Drive create and store their files. In the past, these were held in common or garden directories in the user’s folder – so, for example, OneDrive used to store its files in /Users/ianbetteridge/OneDrive. You could even change this location if you wanted to put it somewhere else.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That, obviously, was too simple for Apple. Now, the “approved” way of being a cloud storage provider is to store files in /User/Library/CloudStorage. This uses the macOS File Provider extension rather than custom kernel extensions, and Apple has indicted it will get rid of custom kernel extensions at some point. It hasn’t happened yet, and some storage providers – notably Nextcloud – still use the old method.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The drawback of this is that the CloudStorage director is, like everything in /Library, hidden. You can’t get to it without either holding down option and selecting the Go menu in the Finder or using the terminal. That means if you remove a cloud provider’s drive from the Locations bar in the Finder windows, you have a fun time trying to find those files again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>More importantly, if you remove a provider, it’s hit or miss whether your files will also be removed. I’ve seen instances where deleting a cloud storage provider’s application also asks if you want to delete the locally stored files. But more often, those files will just stick around, in a directory you can no longer easily access, hogging disk space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s fine as long as you have infinite disk space and didn’t locally cache many files. But I like my files local where possible, which means if I delete, say, OneDrive (which has tens of gigabytes of files in it) I just lose that disk space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, I hear you say, can’t you just navigate to them and delete the directory? Well, no: Apple (helpfully, again) locks those directories against deletion in the Finder. You can delete the files in them, but the folder itself sticks around like a bad smell. And if you reinstall the cloud storage provider again, things seem to break: when I tried this, the folder refused to sync, and of course, couldn’t just be moved, and if it did appear to sync files didn’t open because the Finder was confused about their sync status.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thank you, Apple. You have replaced well-written kernel extensions with your own “universal” version, which actually works less reliably. Well done, people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thankfully, you can completely delete a folder. You just have to go to the terminal and do a little bit of Unix to do it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Open a terminal, and go to the CloudStorage folder – for me, this means typing “cd /Users/ianbetteridge/Library/CloudStorage”, but you will obviously have to replace that with your username.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Type “ls” – this gives you a list of what directories are in there. For example, I have folders called OneDrive-IanBetteridge and Dropbox, for the two cloud storage providers I use.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Now the dangerous bit. Type “sudo rm -r NameOfDirectoryToDelete” (replacing, of course, “NameOfDirectoryToDelete” with the name of the folder you wanted deleting). Terminal can autocomplete names, so you can just type the first few letters of a unique name, hit tab, and it will fill in the rest.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Hit return, and you will be asked for your password. Type it in, hit return again, and that directory <strong>and all its contents</strong> are gone from your Mac, for good, with no real possibility of getting them back. So really do make sure that you’re deleting the directory that you want.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n</ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> And that is what I mean about Apple’s ability to make things less usable. If I was able to just navigate to the folder in the Finder and delete it normally, it would be in the Bin and so, if I make an mistake, easier to recover. But because Apple first instinct every time is to “protect” users and “make it easier”, you need to go to the command line and use a Unix tool which is far more user-hostile and dangerous.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thanks Apple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

But it begins a process which could see publishers get more revenue </h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There has been a lot of controversy over Google and Facebook “stealing” content from publishers. Publishers have been accusing Google of stealing their content for a long time. They claim that Google's search engine and news aggregator are infringing on their copyrights and depriving them of revenue, particularly in a world where more and more answers are appearing on Google’s results pages rather than pushing traffic to publishers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The argument is that Google is using publisher content without paying them or asking for their permission, and that this is unfair and illegal. They also complain that Google is dominating the online advertising market and squeezing out their competitors. Some publishers want Google to pay them for displaying snippets of their articles or linking to their websites, or to stop using their content altogether.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Google, of course, argues that it is providing a valuable service to both publishers and users. It says that it is helping publishers reach a wider audience and drive more traffic to their websites, while also giving users quick and easy access to relevant and high-quality information. Google also points out that it respects the choices of publishers and allows them to opt out of its platforms or customize how their content is displayed.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Gannett, the publisher of USA Today, is not convinced. It has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/20/gannett-sues-google-over-its-alleged-ad-tech-monopoly.html\">sued Google for allegedly monopolizing the advertising technology market</a>, arguing that Google's broad control of the ad tech market has hurt the news industry, as online readership has grown while the proportion of online ad spending taken by publishers has decreased.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Gannett isn’t the only one. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/daily-mail-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-2021-04-20/\">The Daily Mail alleges that Google has too much control over the online advertising market</a>, which has resulted in newspapers seeing little of the revenue that their content produces. The lawsuit claims that Google controls the tools used to sell ad inventory, the space on publishers' pages where ads can be placed, and the exchange that decides where ads will be placed. The Daily Mail argues that this lack of competition depresses prices and reduces the amount and quality of news available to readers. The lawsuit also alleges that Google “punished” publishers who \"do not submit to its practices”.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>A lot of this hinges on copyright, and what amounts to effectively extending its provisions to cover something that’s previously been considered fair use: showing snippets of publisher content to let users decide if they want to click through to the content.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/2023/06/14/saving_the_news_from_big_tech_eff.pdf\">Similarly to Cory Doctorow</a>, I would argue that extending copyright like this is foolish, and ultimately won’t benefit publishers and the rest of the creative industries. What will benefit us is removing the choke points that big tech companies like Google and Facebook own, and that world took a significant step forward this week.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Yesterday, a federal court jury <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-v-google-trial-verdict-a-win-for-all-developers\">ruled in favour of Epic Games</a> in its lawsuit against Google, marking a significant victory for the game developer. The jury found that Google's Android app store, Google Play, uses anticompetitive practices that harm consumers and software developers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Epic Games had accused Google of abusing its dominant position as the developer of Android to strike deals with handset makers and collect excess fees from consumers. Google collects between 15% and 30% for all digital purchases made through its shopfront. Epic tried to bypass those fees by charging users directly for purchases in the popular game Fortnite; Google then removed the game from its store, which led to the lawsuit.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The jury agreed with Epic on every question it was asked to consider, including that Google has monopoly power in the Android app distribution markets and in-app billing services markets, that Google did anticompetitive things in those markets, and that Epic was injured by that behaviour. What the remedy will be is yet to be determined. But even if it is confined solely to Epic, it’s a step towards breaking the stranglehold that Google and Apple have on the app stores and making the 30/15% tithe they take a thing of the past.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Why does this matter to publishers? Because it opens the possibility of publishers getting more control over the way their content is distributed to smartphones, and ultimately take more revenue by, in effect, running their own app stores just for content.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Being able to have an app store just for your publications would mean an immediate increase in revenue. Currently, between 15- and 30% of every in-app subscription or micropayment goes to the tech giants. If publishers could bypass this fee, they would retain a larger portion of their sales, potentially leading to significant financial gains.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This, as Doctorow highlighted, is where Google and Apple have been taking money from publishers – not by “stealing content”, but by stealing <em>revenue.</em> And it has the added bonus of allowing publishers to get a closer relationship with their customers, something that the app store intermediary model removes. . Customers won’t be buying from Apple or Google and the platform passing on the money to you: they will be buying directly from the people who make the content.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Of course, there are also challenges and risks associated with running an app store. These include the technical and financial resources required to develop and maintain it, ensuring security and privacy for users. Publishers would also have to convince users to switch from established platforms like Google Play and the Apple App Store, which takes more investment in marketing.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Of course, there are downsides. Publishers will need to spend more on discovery because it’s unlikely that either Apple or Google would ever promote a competing App Store. But that’s a small price to pay for restoring the direct relationship you have with customers. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On Tuesday, I attended (virtually, of course) an International Association of News Media (INMA) talk given by Benedict Evans on the future of news. I like Ben’s approach, which is basically to keep reminding news people that putting all their eggs in the basked of Google and Facebook was a bad idea, and no amount of begging them for money is going to make it better. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As Cory often points out, the problem isn’t Google “stealing content” – it’s that Google and Facebook have an effective duopoly over online ads. They are stealing money rather than content. Focusing on MOAR COPYRIGHT isn’t going to fix that. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I spent far too much time this week futzing around with technology rather than doing anything productive with it. Tech is my absolute best (worst) prevarication method. Instead of just getting on and <em>doing stuff with the tech,</em> I spend time farting around with it, installing this, playing around with that. It gives me the illusion of doing something constructive when I’m actually doing nothing of the sort. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing I did was to change my contract with Ionos, which I use to host and hold the various domains I have. Back in the old days, I used to self-host WordPress, which I stopped doing when I managed to corrupt an entire database and lose about a decade’s worth of posts. I was still paying for services which I no longer needed, including legacy support for outdated versions of MySQL, so managed to cut down my costs quite considerably. I should have done that sooner. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One project which I might embark on is to trim back my online presences and consolidate into one site. I currently have my tech blog, this site, and also a Substack. Oh, and a small site on Writing.as for short fiction. I’m tempted to merge them all into one, on WordPress, which would be cheaper to run and potentially make more sense. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I am definitely not embarking on this for a while. Too much other stuff to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One project which I really do have to get to grips with is consolidating all my files into a single, coherent place. Every time someone has launched a new online file storage system, I have tried it out. That used to be excusable – it was my job to know about stuff like this – but now it’s not, and it’s in desperate need of consolidation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have files on Dropbox, iCloud Drive, and two different OneDrives. There’s a lot of duplication, but the structure of all of them is quite different. It’s going to be a semi-manual mess to work out how to get it all in one place. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that’s not even thinking about <strong>which</strong> place it should be. My main rule is that everything must be stored locally on at least one machine, which then gets locally backed up, and as the ThinkPad is the device with the most storage that rules out iCloud. OneDrive seems reluctant to store everything locally, even when I tell it to. That leaves Dropbox.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But that means paying for another storage service, which seems silly when I have a lot of OneDrive storage space. I have a personal Microsoft 365 account, for access to Word/Excel/PowerPoint, and that gives me 1Tb of OneDrive storage, effectively thrown in for nothing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have the free version of Dropbox, but because I have had it for a long time and they have done a lot of “get free storage” promos over the years, it gives me nearly 9Gb of free space. That’s enough for a decent-sized “working documents” folder, storage everything that’s in use. Everything else can be be archived easily. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So perhaps that’s a good first step: get everything on to the ThinkPad, which is easily done, sort all the files, and use Dropbox for “working documents”. Sounds like a plan. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But not for today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three things which caught my attention this week</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Timothy Burke is a journalist who had his devices seized by the FBI in an investigation into <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/27/journalist-tells-fbi-to-give-back-devices-seized-during-extremely-questionable-investigation-into-leaked-fox-news-footage/\">“leaked” Fox News footage</a>.

I had wiped it completely – something that’s a bit of a saga in its own right – and intended to sell it.</p>\n\n<p>The buyer I had in mind wasn’t able to take it as unfortunately, they had some financial mishaps, and I would rather not sell it via eBay or classified. So it has just sat there doing nothing. </p>\n\n<p>I decided to set it up and use it for a while, just to remind myself of what it was like. It’s the last generation of Intel machine, and I bought it not long before the announcement of the M-series chips. Although it was the lowest-end of 16in MacBook Pro, it’s still a pretty good computer and it seemed a shame for it to be doing nothing. </p>\n\n<p>I’m glad I did because it’s reminded me how much I like a big screen laptop. It’s nowhere near as good for either performance or battery life as the Air, but it’s still more than fast enough for everything I need to do. And as I am unlikely to stray far from the house with it I don’t need to worry too much about the battery. </p>\n\n<p>Now I just have to think about a name for it because the default “Ian’s MacBook Pro” seems a little bit soulless. </p>\n\n<h2>Installing Brew</h2>\n\n<p>Whenever I get a new Mac or resurrect an old one, I start from scratch rather than reinstall from a backup. This lets me work out which applications I actually need. Because I like to try out many applications, I end up with a lot of software on my machines which I don’t actually use much.</p>\n\n<p>The days when this mattered from the perspective of system maintenance are long gone. Most applications are spraying extensions, libraries, or even (lord help us) DLLs all over your system. Even Linux has self-contained application installs now, thanks to technologies like AppImage, Flatpak and Snap. </p>\n\n<p>But it’s still a waste of disk space and feels inelegant, so I set everything up with a clean slate and only install when I like using. </p>\n\n<p>One thing that always gets installed on any Mac is <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">Brew</a>, the package manager, which is the de facto standard for installing Unix apps on an Apple computer. macOS is, of course, based on Unix, but the default set up doesn’t include the kind of software which usually comes as standard – utilities like ffmpeg, for example. </p>\n\n<p>You can install them, though, and Brew makes is easy. It’s a command line tool which works in the same way as a regular Linux package manager, like DNF on Fedora or APT on Debian-derivatives. Once you have installed Brew using a single line of commands, you can type <code>brew install</code> and the name of the software you want, and it will do all the installation you need. </p>\n\n<p>Brew lets you fill the holes which Apple has left. For example, the first thing I install with it is <code>wget</code>, which isn’t part of the standard macOS and which I find very useful. I also add <code>yt-dlp</code> so I can download video from YouTube and other services, as well as <code>get_iplayer</code> to tap into the BBC’s archives. </p>\n\n<p>There’s a lot more you can do with Brew, and if you are used to the command line I recommend it. </p>\n",

If you wanted to know about new processors, the transputer, or something even more esoteric, Byte was a great place to keep informed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It also had Jerry Pournelle. Science fiction writer, conservative, and holder (in later life) of some dubious views, Jerry was nonetheless one of the most influential early computer journalists. I loved his columns, which stretched out to 5,000 words or so per issue. They were written from the perspective of an ordinary computer user — albeit one that had the kind of knowledge required to run a computer in the days of the S100 bus and CP/M.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thankfully, the Internet Archive has every issue of Byte, scanned and neatly labelled. Annoyingly though, there isn’t a single collection which has every issue in it, which means it’s not easy to just download everything.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And having local copies is vital for me, as I use DEVONThink for research, and it wants a local set of PDFs. So I have started putting together the definitive collection of every single issue, and once I’ve done it I will put them somewhere online, so people can download the whole set. It’s big – my incomplete version is about 7Gb, and I estimate the full set is about 10Gb – but at least they will be there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This took quite a while to do this week, and I'm pleased with the results.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Chanel</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I went to see the <a href=\"https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/gabrielle-chanel-fashion-manifesto\">Chanel show at the V&amp;A</a> – I don’t really like Chanel’s clothes that much, but her accessories are amazing and she had a really fantastic eye for patterns.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Seeing the collection emphasised that once she created the classic suit, so much of what she did was just more of the same. Milking a hit isn’t necessarily a bad thing: but the small card which notes she “attempted to extend the suit from day to evening wear” is a bit of a giveaway. She didn’t <em>just</em> make more suits. But she was more than happy to keep churning out endless slight variants in a way which made her a lot of money.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was a little disappointing that the exhibition basically skips over the nine years when she could not work in France because she was widely believed to have collaborated with the Nazis. She had an affair with a German officer and used his connections to protect a relative. Literally one sign, with no more than 30 words on it, and then skipping merrily on to her return in 1954.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, there is more space devoted to the one document from 1943 which lists her as working with the resistance, although <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20231127-historian-debunks-claims-that-coco-chanel-served-in-the-french-resistance\">there is no documentation (and no one remembers) exactly what she did with them</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is, of course, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/04/books/review/sleeping-with-the-enemy-coco-chanels-secret-war-by-hal-vaughan-book-review.html\">far more documentation listing her as a Nazi agent</a>. She definitely benefitted from the Germans’ Aryanization laws, which let her get control of her perfume business from the Jewish Wertheimer brothers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s no doubt that Chanel collaborated, and that her high-placed contacts (Churchill, Duff Cooper, and many others) protected her after the war. None of this is mentioned, perhaps because once you understand what she did and what she was, it’s much less likely that you will just want to admire the pretty clothes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don’t think it’s possible to understand Chanel-the-person without considering that period of her life. And the exhibition doesn’t have the excuse that it’s solely about her influence on fashion (there’s surprisingly little which contextualises her in that sense). It ends when she dies, so it's not about Chanel the brand or even really her legacy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In that sense, it’s a massive contrast to <em>Diva</em>, which is also on at the V&amp;A and which managed to reduce me to tears when I saw it. <em>Diva</em> is a brilliant bit of curation in ways that <em>Chanel</em> is not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, if you do go to the V&amp;A, get yourself a piece of the pear and caramel cake. It’s really rather fine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Three things you should read this week</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/elon-musk-nyt-interview-18524602.php\">The End of Elon Musk</a>.

Why is it that people who crow loudest about “keeping politics out of work” so often bring their politics to work?

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} --><h2>What does the search engine of the future look like? Forget 10 blue links...</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You can break down the creative process into three big chunks: research, creation and revision. What happens in part depends largely on the kinds of content you're creating, the platforms you are making the content for, and many other factors.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Like every journalist, I spent a lot of time using search on the web to help with that research phase. I was quick off the mark with it, and I learned to adapt my queries to the kinds of phrases which delivered high-quality results in Google. My Google-fu was second to none.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But that was the biggest point: like all nascent technologies, I had to adapt to it rather than the other way around. Google was <em>great</em> compared to what came before it, but it was still a dumb computer which required human knowledge to make the most of out of it.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>And Google was dumb in another way too: apart from spelling mistakes, it didn't really help you refine what you were looking for based on the results you got. If you typed in “property law” you would get a mishmash of results for developers, office managers and homeowners. You would have to do another search, say for “property law homeowners” to get an entirely different* set of results that were tailored for you.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Google got better at using other information it knows about you (your IP address, your Google profile) to refine what it shows you. But it didn't help you form the right query. It would ask you “hey, what aspects of property law are you interested in” and give you a list of more specific topics.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>What's more, what it “knew” about you were pretty useless. You couldn't, at any point, tell it something which would really help it give you the kinds of results you wanted. You couldn't, for example, tell it \"I'm a technology journalist with a lot of experience, and I favour sources which come from established sites which mostly cover tech. I also like to get results from people who work for the companies that the query is about, so make sure you show those to me too. Oh, and I'm in the UK, so take that into account.\"</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Google isn't like that now. Partly that's down to the web itself being <a href=\"https://www.searchenginejournal.com/why-google-search-is-getting-worse/472681/\">a much worse source of information</a>. But that feels like a huge cop-out from a company whose mission is to “<a href=\"https://about.google/\">organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful</a>”. It sounds like what it is: a shrug, a way of saying that the company's technology isn't good enough to find \"the good stuff\".</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The search engine of the future should:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul>\n<li><p>Be able to parse a natural language query and understand all its nuances. Remember how in the Knowledge Navigator video, our professor could ask just for “recent papers”?</p></li>\n<li><p>Know not just the kind of information about you that's useful for the targeting of ads (yes Google, this is you) but also the nuances of who you are and be able to base its results on what you're likely to need.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reply in natural language, including links to any sources it has used to give you answers.</p></li>\n<li><p>If it's not sure about the kind of information you require, ask you for clarification: search should be a conversation.</p></li>\n</ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For the past few weeks, I've been using <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\">Perplexity</a> as my main search engine. And it comes about as close as is currently possible to that ideal search engine. If you create content of any kind, you should take a look at it.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Perplexity AI allows users to pose questions directly and receive concise, accurate answers backed up by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannechen/2023/09/06/how-perplexityai-is-pioneering-the-future-of-search/?sh=2663c868ad91\">a curated set of sources</a>. It's an “answer engine” powered by large language models (including both <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/perplexity-ask-anything/id1668000334\">OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude 2</a>). The technology behind Perplexity AI involves an internal web browser that performs the user's query in the background using Bing, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/perplexity_ai/comments/11j1qe3/how_does_perplexityai_works/\">then feeds the obtained information to the AI model to generate a response</a></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Basically, it uses an LLM-based model to create a prompt for a conventional search engine, does the search, finds answers and summarises what it's found in natural language, with links back to sources. But it also has a system it calls (confusingly) Copilot, which provides a more interactive and personalised search experience. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 model to guide users through their search process with interactive inputs, leading to more accurate and comprehensive responses.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Copilot is particularly useful for researching complex topics. It can go back and forth on the specific information users need before curating answers with links to websites and Wolfram Alpha data. It also has a strong summarisation ability and can sift through large texts to find the right answers to a user's question.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This kind of back-and-forth is obviously costly (especially as Copilot queries use GPT-4 rather than the cheaper GPT-3.5). To manage demand and the cost of accessing the advanced GPT-4 model, Perplexity AI limits users to five Copilot queries every four hours, or 600 a day if you are a paid for “Pro” user.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you're not using Perplexity for research, I would strongly recommend giving it a go. And if you work for Google, get on the phone to Larry and tell him your company might need to spend a lot of money to buy Perplexity.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

But the basics are that OpenAI’s board dismissed Sam Altman, its founder and CEO, alleging he had been less than truthful with them. Half the company then decided they wanted to leave. Microsoft’s Satya Nadella then claimed Altman would be joining his company, only to walk that back later in the day. Now Altman is going back to OpenAI as CEO but not on the board and there will be an “independent investigation” into what went on, something that might not totally exonerate Altman.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Confused?

The <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html\">$13bn it has put in since 2019 for an estimated 49% stake</a> of the company and the fact it is integrating OpenAI tech into everything it does mean it has a lot to lose (and Satya Nadella <a href=\"https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/it-is-like-buying-openai-says-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-after-being-asked-if-hes-buying-australia-after-indias-world-cup-loss-406543-2023-11-21\">does not like losing</a>.)</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Because of this, I think the past few days won’t have much impact on the longer-term future of AI. In fact, it could end a good thing, as it means Microsoft has committed that it will step in should OpenAI start to slip.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The greatest challenge for Microsoft was that, although it had perpetual licenses to OpenAI’s models and code, it didn’t own the tech outright, and it didn’t have the people in house. And, when you’re betting your company’s future on a technology, you’re always in a better position if you own what you need (something that publishers should take note of).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Partners are great, but if you’re locked into a single partner, and they have what you require, you’re never going to be the driver of your fate. Now, though, if Altman and the gang join, Microsoft effectively owns all it needs to do whatever it wants. It has the team. It has the intellectual property. Everything runs, and will continue to run, on Azure, and it has the financial muscle to invest in the huge amount of hardware required to make it available to more businesses.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The big question for me is how all this impacts on Google over the next few years. If Altman and half of OpenAI ends up joining Microsoft, I think it weakens Google substantially: at that point, Microsoft owns everything it needs to power ahead with AI in all its products, and the more Microsoft integrates AI, the stronger a competitor it will be.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If, on the other hand, Altman goes back to OpenAI with more of a free hand to push the technology further and harder, Microsoft still benefits through its partnership, but to a lesser degree.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If I was running Google, I would be calling Aravind Srinivas and asking how much it would take to buy Perplexity.

There is a third area, and in a sense it’s about going back to the future and focusing on something that never truly went out of fashion: original reporting.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Back in 2008, <a href=\"https://www.oblomovka.com/wp/category/living-on-the-edge/\">my reserve arch enemy Danny O’Brien and I were debating what the difference was between blogging and “proper” journalism</a>, and Danny ended up liking one of the ways I put it: that “journalism is when you pick up the phone”. Even then, that didn’t mean a literal phone – email was the hot communications thing. But it meant, as Danny put it, “journalism requires some actual original research, rather than just randomly googling or getting emailed something and writing it up as news.”</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>That’s the core of original reporting, and as Danny also pointed out, a great deal of what passes as editorial doesn’t meet that standard (opinion columnists of the UK media, stop looking so shifty).  </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Original reporting in any topic area is about uncovering truths, providing context, and delivering stories that matter to audiences. AI, while adept at aggregating and rephrasing existing information, lacks the ability to conduct investigative journalism, engage in ethical decision-making, and provide the human empathy that is often central to impactful storytelling. I would consider myself broadly an optimist about the developing capabilities of AI, and even I don’t think it’s likely to be able to do this in my lifetime.  </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>And “picking up the phone” is definitely having something of a renaissance. Take, for example, the series that The Verge is currently working on under the label of “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23943463/sustainability-tech-climate-change-ai-housing-ev\">we only get one planet</a>”. Digging into how <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23951200/right-to-repair-law-apple-ifixit-iphone\">Apple and others add to the mountain of e-waste while claiming to be on top of their environmental efforts</a> takes a lot of work, and importantly, original research and interviews. The Verge might not be physically picking up the phone, but they’re more than living up to the spirit.  </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Obviously, investing in original reporting is expensive, and it can’t just be a moral imperative. It has to be a sound business strategy, too. First, audiences appreciate its value. According to a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/dataset/spring-2019-survey-data/\">2019 Pew Research survey</a>, “about seven-in-ten U.S. adults (71%) say it is very important for journalists to do their own reporting, rather than relying on sources that do not do their own reporting, such as aggregators or social media. Another 22% say this is somewhat important, while just 6% say it is not too or not at all important.”</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Original reporting can elevate a publisher's brand reputation and recognition, which can be a key to unlocking more direct traffic. In a saturated market, having a distinct journalistic voice and a reputation for in-depth reporting can be a significant differentiator.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Publications like The New York Times and The Guardian have successfully leveraged their reputations for quality journalism to build robust subscription or contribution-based revenue models, with The Guardian hitting <a href=\"https://www.niemanlab.org/2023/07/the-guardian-keeps-growing-internationally-in-both-revenue-and-journalism/\">record annual revenue this year</a>. And, importantly for its long-term profitability, <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/website/theguardian.com/#traffic-sources\">nearly half its traffic is direct</a> (and its biggest search terms are branded ones).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One thing that’s worth noting: <a href=\"https://www.marketingweek.com/how-the-guardian-used-planning-purpose-and-products-to-revive-revenue/\">The Guardian’s strategy was a three-year plan</a>. Do you have a three-year plan to diversify revenue, have a more direct relationship with your audience, and leave yourself less vulnerable to the whims of Google or Facebook?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><div class=\"captioned-button-wrap\">\n<div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thank you for reading Ian Betteridge's Substack.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} --><h2>The second area where humans can do a better job than an LLM: real life storytelling</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the best parts of my last year working at <a href=\"https://www.bauermedia.co.uk/\">Bauer</a> was getting to know the team which works on real life content. Real life, sometimes called true life or reader stories, focuses on stories derived from ordinary people caught up in extraordinary events – usually not the national news, but their own personal dramas.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are many magazines whose focus is entirely real life, and you will have seen them on many supermarket shelves with multiple cover lines, often focused on shocking stories. But the key part about them, and the thing which differentiates them from tabloids, is that the stories are those told by the people involved in the drama. It's not third-person reporting: it is focused on first-person experience.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>And now a confession: before I worked with that team, and I suspect like many journalists, my view of real life wasn't all that positive. I considered it to be cheap, and pretty low-end.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>How wrong I was.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I worked with the team creating the content to implement a new planning system, which needed to capture every part of their story creation process. What I learned was how thorough their process is, and how much human care and attention they had to take when telling what were sometimes traumatic stories, working directly with the subject.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I don't think I have ever worked with a team that had a more thorough legal and fact-checking process, and I came away a bit awed by them. I ended up thinking that if all journalists operated with their level of professionalism and standards, the industry would be in a much better place.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} --><h2>Bringing the human into the story</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Where does AI come into this? <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.substack.com/p/what-kinds-of-content-can-humans\">I talked earlier this week</a> about how injecting more of a human, emotional element into reviews was a way to make them stand out in a field that AI is going to disrupt. Real life is a perfect example of a topic where it's difficult to ever see a large learning model (LLM) being able to create the story.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>An LLM can't do an interview, and because of the incredible sensitivity of the stories being told, I wouldn't trust a machine to write even a first draft of it. But there are aspects of the way that real life content is created which, I believe, can give lessons to every kind of journalism.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>First, whatever your topic area, telling the human story is always going to be something that humans do better than machines. Build emotion and empathy into telling a personal story, rather than relating just the facts. That doesn’t just mean technique: yes, use emotional arcs, and yes, show don’t tell, but technique alone won’t bring across the way that the subject felt when going through whatever event they are describing.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>On a three-to-five-year timescale, I would be looking to shift human journalists into telling more of these kinds of stories, regardless of what your topic area. Remember that humans are empathic storytellers and focus on the emotion of the story. <strong>So, think about how you can change your content strategy to be more focused on the human story.</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} --><h2>The process is the practice</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Don't, though, be tempted to work on these kinds of stories with an ad hoc process. Process is important in journalism – but it is crucial if you want to do real life stories well.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>To do this well, make sure you codify and document the process to a high level. Documenting the process is often something that journalists can push back on because it's considered stifling creativity, but that's not true at all. In fact, a documented process allows you to free up time to focus on creative tasks, rather than reinventing the wheel with every story.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>And that is where you can start to think about how to use LLMs to streamline your processes and make them move faster. But this is a business process problem, rather than a creative one.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For example, if your pitching process involves creating a summary of a story, an LLM can write the summary – there's no need to waste a human's time to do it. Can you write a <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts\">specialist GPT</a> to check if a story has been used before? Can you use an LLM to query your content management system for similar stories you may have run in the past?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you are thinking about how to be a successful publisher in three to five years, you need to be looking at the process. If it's not documented – in detail – then make sure that's done. That can't be a one-off because a process is never a single entity fixed for all time. New technologies and new more efficient practices will come along, and someone needs to be responsible within your organisation for it.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So, ask yourself some questions:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list --><ul>\n<li><p>Who, in my company, is directly responsible for documenting and maintaining our editorial and audience development processes?</p></li>\n<li><p>Where are they documented?</p></li>\n<li><p>How often are they maintained?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are they transparent? Does everyone know where they are?</p></li>\n</ul><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Once you have a fully documented process, you can start to interrogate it for points where AI can be used to speed things up, where using natural language queries to a specialist model can improve the work. That way, you can leave humans to do the work they're best at: emotion, and storytelling.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The last few posts here have, I have to admit, been a bit of doom and gloom. I’ve looked at how conversational AI is going to squeeze search traffic to publisher sites, and at how adopting AI for content generation will remove the key competitive advantage of publishers. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>But there are areas of content creation where publishers can use their ability to do things at scale and the talent they have to make great work that audiences will love.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:jetpack/subscriptions /--><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I’ve broken this post out into three parts, covering three different kinds of content. Today, I’m going to look at one which is close to my heart: reviews. Tomorrow and Thursday I’ll look at two other examples where humans can win.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} --><h2>Doing reviews right</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>One of the points that I made last week was that affiliate content, in particular, was susceptible to the shift to conversational ways of working with computers. However, that doesn’t mean that reviews are going to disappear. Certain types of article are likely to remain an area where humans will continue to produce better content for other humans for the foreseeable future.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>For many sites, creating content for affiliate purposes has involved a lot of round-up articles, often created at least in part with what gets called “desk-based research”. You are not reviewing a product you have in your hand, you are researching everything about it that a consumer could possibly need to know, and summarizing it helpfully.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I’ve sometimes argued this was OK in certain circumstances, as long as you flag it and the amount of work that goes into the article is high. Just casting around for whatever is top-rated on Amazon doesn’t cut it because a reader can do that quickly themselves. But if you’re saving someone hours of time in research, you’re still performing a valuable service for them.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>That kind of content isn’t going to survive the increased use of conversational AI because one thing that LLMs will be excellent at is ingesting lots of data and combining it into a cogent recommendation. LLMs can read every piece of Amazon feedback, every spec sheet and every piece of manufacturer data faster and more accurately than any human can. If your content is just research, it’s not going to be viable in the world of AI.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>What will work is direct first-person experience of the product, written to focus on the less tangible things about it. An LLM can read a car spec sheet and tell you about its torque, but it can’t tell you how it feels to accelerate it around a corner. An LLM can look at a spec sheet for a laptop, but it can’t tell you how good the keyboard is to type on for extended periods.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If your editorial teams are focused on what I used to call “speeds, feeds and data” then part of your approach should be to shake up the way they write to get them closer to a more personal perspective. One way to do this is to change style.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Back when we launched Alphr at Dennis, one of the first changes I made to editorial style was to stop using the UK tech traditional plural in reviews (“we tested this and found blah”) and shift to first person (“I tested this and found blah”). Shifting into first person forces the writer into a more subjectively human perspective on the product you’re looking it. It frees the writer from an overly objective point of view into a more personal experience, and that is something which will survive the world of LLMs. Don’t just say what the specs are: say what it feels like, as a human being, to use this product.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p><strong>Tomorrow, I’m going to look at the second area I think is a clear “win” for human-generated content: the often maligned area of real life stories.</strong></p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:jetpack/subscriptions /-->\n",

The ability to take apart pretty-much any Mac you cared to name became very useful later on.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:jetpack/subscriptions /--><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Apple treated new interns the same as every other new employee, which meant that there was an off-site induction for a couple of days when we were told about the past, present, and future of Apple. The only part of the induction that I remember is the future because that was when I first saw the <em>Knowledge Navigator</em> video. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you haven't seen Knowledge Navigator, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umJsITGzXd0\">you should watch it now</a>.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Why is a 36-year-old concept video relevant now, and what does it have to do with publishing? The vision of how humans and computers interact which Knowledge Navigator puts forward is finally on the cusp of coming true. And that has <em>profound</em> implications for how we find information, which in turn affects publishers.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are three elements of the way Knowledge Navigator works which, I think, are most interesting: conversational interaction; querying information, not directing to pages; and the AI as proactive assistant. I'm going to look at the first one: interaction as conversation, and how close we are to it. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} --><h1>Interaction as conversation</h1><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/cf28128f3d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The interaction model in Knowledge Navigator is <em>conversational</em>. Our lecturer talks to the AI as if it were a real person, and the interaction between them is two-way. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote --><blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Lecturer: “Let me see the lecture notes from last semester”. Mhmm… no, that's not enough. I need to review the more recent literature.

Bing Chat responds to questions, but it doesn't ask me to clarify my queries if it isn't certain about what I'm asking for… yet. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>That aside, the way conversation happens between our lecturer and his intelligent agent is remarkably similar to what you can do with Bing Chat or Bard now. The “lecture notes from last semester” is a query about local data, which both Microsoft and Google are focused on for their business software, Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace. The external search for journal articles is the equivalent of interrogating Bing or Bard about a topic. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In fact, Bing already does a pretty good job here.

The interaction comes at Google's end, not the publishers. Our current model looks like this:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} --><ol>\n<li><p>A person interacts with Google, making a query. </p></li>\n<li><p>They click through to a result on the page which (hopefully) gives them an answer</p></li>\n<li><p>If they want to refine their query, they go back to Google and repeat the process – potentially going to another page  </p></li>\n</ol><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Interaction as conversation changes this dynamic completely, as an “intelligent” search engine gives the person the answer and then allows them to refine and converse about that query immediately – without going to another page. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Have a look at this conversation with Bard, where I am asking for a recommendation for a 14in laptop:  </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/5ad1c0f845.jpg\" alt=\"\"></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>OK, that sounds good.

That's particularly true for those who grew up with the web, aged between 30-60. It may take time for this group to move away from wanting pages to wanting AI-driven conversations which lead to answers. But sooner or later, they will move. And younger demographics will move faster.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>That, of course, assumes that Google will leave the choice to users.

The highlight of this week was at the Royal Festival Hall on Monday, when we drove into London (more on that in a moment) to see Brian Eno and the Baltic Sea Philharmonic perform Eno’s album <em>The Ship</em> along with a handful of other songs. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was of course brilliant, and incredibly moving. One of the additional songs that they performed was <em>Bone Bomb</em> from 2005’s <em>Another Day on Earth</em>, which is song rooted in the testimonies of two people; a teenage girl Palestinian suicide bomber; and an Israeli doctor who talked about how he had learned to pull fragments of the bones of suicide bombers from the bodies of their victims. It was incredibly affecting: I cried. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eno is one of the artistic anchor points of my life. I first ran into his work in the early 80’s, when in my teens I bought a second hand copy of <em>Another Green World</em> and instantly knew that I wanted to be able to make art like that. I never quite succeeded in that aim – whatever my writing is, it’s not like Eno’s!. But he’s always been an inspiration in the way that he has had the fearlessness to do what he wanted to do without worrying too much about either immediate ability or the artificial boundaries which people set between the different creative domains. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once a year, I reread his <em>A Year with Swollen Appendices</em>, which I think should be on the required reading list for any course in any creative field. No matter what you do creatively, you will get something out of it. You might not like Eno more at the end of it, but I think that’s actually to Eno’s credit.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I mentioned, we drove rather than getting the train. Environmentally of course that is a poor decision. But it’s also literally half the price of travelling when there are two people, even including the parking and ULEZ charge. We drive to Woolwich and get the Elizabeth line from there; the fuel costs about £10, compared to about £80 for two people to get the train. I remember reading that the line to Canterbury is, per mile, the most expensive passenger railway in the world, and I can believe it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, this journey turned into a rather more expensive one, because on the way back we blew a tyre on the M2 and had to call recovery to pick us and the car up. Unfortunately our coverage had also run out, which meant that the total cost of recovery was just north of £200. Plus, of course, the tyre needed replacing (another £80). The God of Nature got their revenge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of weeks I started a <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.substack.com\">Substack</a>. I wanted to create a series of posts which look at how technology is impacting on publishing, and I have started with a focus on how the main sources of traffic for publishers – Google, Facebook – are going to fade in importance over the next few years as they begin to keep more people on their own pages and produce more immediate answers to queries using large language models (LLMs, which I am trying to not call AI – because while they are definitely artificial, they are not intelligent). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think the audience development community of which I was (am?) a part is, at least publicly, in a bit of denial about this. The reaction to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/features/23931789/seo-search-engine-optimization-experts-google-results\">the article on The Verge</a> about SEO’s impact on the web was a good demonstration of this: a lot of SEO people were <strong>very</strong> defensive about it, which is never a good look (if you’re confident about your work, you don’t get prickly when someone doesn’t understand what you do). I think I’m going to write something about that this week.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some people have asked about Substack and why I’m using it. The answer is mostly that it’s much easier to get an audience there than it is to create a standalone newsletter. Substack does part of the work of promoting it for you, and it <strong>does</strong> work. That said, I also understand that some people have an ethical (and practical) objection to using a platform like Substack, so I’m going to create an alternative way of signing up this week somewhere else (probably Buttondown).

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} --><h2>LLMs remove a key competitive advantage of publishers. You need to find a new one.</h2><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It still surprises me that I’m old enough to have been part of the transition from print publishing to digital, but what surprises me more is that publishers are again making some of the same mistakes they made in that early internet era. But this time, it’s about the use of large language models to generate content, and it’s even being made by digital natives.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>A little bit of history is probably useful here. Back in the mid to late 1990s, many publishers saw online content in terms of its ability to reduce their costs. Paper, printing and distribution of physical magazines were expensive. Publishing content online, though, was basically free. This, the theory went, would allow publishers to cut costs those costs and make more money.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:jetpack/subscriptions /--><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>What most publishers didn’t understand was that the high costs of production associated with print were their main advantage because they acted as a barrier to entry for new competitors. Starting a magazine was hard: you had to not only have enough capital to allow you to print and distribute the thing, you needed access to news-stand distribution, which in the UK meant working with big distributors who had to be persuaded to stock you. You needed a sales team to sell enough advertising to support it, and they needed contact books that were thick enough to get their feet in the doors. Magazine publishing was expensive, and only large publishers were able to get it done at scale.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>By the mid-1990s, though, anyone could publish online. All those competitive advantages disappeared within a couple of years. You could publish easily using platforms like Blogger, WordPress, or even Myspace. You could get ad revenue from systems like Google Ads, without a sales team of any sort. Not only that, but you could get your content seen via Google search and social platforms.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>It took publishers a long time to realise that the old barriers to entry no longer protected them. Some publishers still act like they think they do, and so appear consistently dazzled when a new platform comes along and makes individuals who take advantage of it into millionaires. TikTok is the latest, but it’s by no means the first. Online was a <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-08-nokia-ceo-stephen-elop-rallies-troops-in-brutally-honest-burnin.html\">burning platform moment</a> for publishers, and some of them took far too long to see it.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} --><h1>The next burning platform</h1><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The ability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to create content is, of course, being seized on by publishers who see it as a method of creating editorial content without having to pay anyone to do it – or, at least, by paying <em>fewer people</em> to do it (and probably cheaper ones too – that was another outcome of the move from print to digital). If you’re a publisher reading that and shaking your head, thinking “well that’s not what we’re doing” I am going to give you a small monkey side eye because we all know that if you’re not thinking that way, your CFO probably is:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:image {\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} --><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/af18c163fb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></figure><!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There’s nothing wrong with using new technology to reduce costs, <strong>as long as you retain your competitive advantage.</strong> And here’s where things are difficult for publishers because what LLMs do is similar to what happened with web publishing in the 1990s: it removes the competitive advantage of publishers in the creation of content, just as the web removed their advantage in publishing and distributing it. It is the next step in the democratisation of publishing.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>In the early internet publishing era, anyone could create any content and put it online, but to be successful they needed to have the expertise to write the content in the first place. That’s why niches like technology publishing were impacted early and heavily: there was plenty of expertise out there, and suddenly, they could create content directly without an intermediary.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Now, thanks to LLMs, anyone in the proverbial bedroom can create swathes of “good enough” content on <em>any topic they want</em>. They can churn out hundreds of average pieces about anything, just by taking a list of the most popular search queries in that topic as their starting point. They’re not flawless, but they’re good enough, particularly to answer the kinds of search queries which publishers have used to generate traffic at scale.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>This is why, for publishers, AI content creation is another burning platform moment. Combine it with the <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.substack.com/p/seo-will-be-over-for-publishers-you\">move towards providing more answers directly on search pages</a>, and you have a one-two punch to publisher traffic which Mike Tyson would be proud of.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Of course, <strong>publishers can use LLMs too</strong>. But, as with early internet publishing, their size means they can neither move fast nor with low enough fixed costs to make it work. If a proverbial 16-year-old can create an article with ChatGPT on “10 things you didn’t know about Mila Kunis” at the same speed as a celebrity magazine, at the same quality, the magazine loses even if it has used technology to eliminate roles and cut its costs. Because, unlike our 16-year-old, it has big fixed costs: offices, equipment, pensions, you name it. And it has margins to protect because the stock market expects to see revenue growth every year.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} --><h1>Regaining competitive advantage</h1><!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So what can publishers do to retain their competitive advantage? There really is no point in trying to pretend that the AI genii doesn’t exist, in the same way that publishers couldn’t pretend in the 90s that people would just carry on buying huge volumes of print.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Nor will legal claims aimed at the likes of OpenAI, Google and Microsoft succeed. Yes, your content has been scraped to create the language models in the first place. But given the result in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc.\">Author’s Guild vs Google Books case</a>, I expect courts to hold that this kind of use is transformative, and therefore fair use. Either way, it will be tied up in the legal system for far too long to make a difference. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Some have suggested that the way forward will be private large language models built solely using the corpus of text publishers hold. There are a few issues with this, but the biggest one is simply that <strong>the horse has bolted.</strong> OpenAI, Google and others have already trained their models on everything you have published online to date. They probably even have access to content which you no longer have. How many redirects of old, outdated content do you have in place where the original no longer exists? How many of your articles now only exist in the Wayback Machine?</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Instead, the only option for publishers is to focus on <strong>creating content of a higher quality than any current LLM</strong>. You cannot gain competitive advantage at the cheap, low-cost end of the market. Trying to do so will not only make you vulnerable to anyone else with the same tools (at $20 a month) but also devalue your brand over the long term.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Creating higher quality content means employing people, which is why that urge to use LLMs to <em>replace</em> your editorial teams will actually undermine the ability of publishers to survive. Putting that cost saving towards your bottom line today is a guarantee that you will be out-competed and lose revenue in the future.</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>So what can you do with LLMs? The most important thing is that LLMs can be used as a tool to amplify the creativity and ability of editorial teams. They are most useful as what Steve Jobs used to call “<a href=\"https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/\">a bicycle for the mind</a>”, capable of amplifying human creativity. An LLM can give you a starting point, suggest an outline on any topic, rewrite a headline 100 times using the word “crow” and it never gets tired doing so. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>If you’re a publisher, you probably still have decades worth of experience, context, contacts and knowledge of audiences in your editorial teams. Train them on how to use LLMs to amplify their creativity (and if you want some help with that, <a href=\"mailto:ian@ianbetteridge.com\">email me</a>!)</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>You’re going to have to change your content strategy to <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/ianbetteridge/p/seo-will-be-over-for-publishers-you?r=2dyvc3&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web\">adapt to the new world of falling Google traffic anyway</a>.

But there is a clear direction here: more answers to search queries will be delivered without any click-through to publishers. And product shopping queries are going to become something which Google channels to retailers (who, by complete coincidence, are also advertisers) rather than publishers (who, by and large, are not).</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>I estimate that publishers have a window of between three and five years to change content strategies to adapt to this new world, depending on the speed of user adoption. It could be faster: much will depend on how quickly Google's LLM work starts to move from an experiment to delivering real results. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The long-term answer for publishers is to reduce exposure to Google as a source of traffic. That's going to be tough: almost every site I have worked on relied on Google for between 60-90% of its traffic. And the more the site was focused on affiliate revenue and e-commerce, the higher that percentage was. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>The answer is to focus on increasing your level of direct traffic, making your site a destination for content rather than something users hit once and bounce away from. Learn lessons from marketing: treat every piece of content you create as an opportunity to deepen your relationship with your audience. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>There are five things I would recommend publishers start doing today:</p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} --><ol>\n<li><p><strong>Refocus your KPIs and OKRs to be about deepening relationships, not just traffic</strong>. Focus on repeat visits and sign-ups. Look to increase the number of qualified email addresses you have (and whatever you do, don't succumb to the temptation to capture more data. If you deliver value, you will capture more over time -- but all you need now is a person's email address).</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Reevaluate your search strategy and focus on topics with complexity</strong>. The more complex the content, the higher its quality, the less likely it is that an LLM can deliver a good quality version of it. Expertise and depth will be essential, and complex topic areas might be the “last person standing” when it comes to Google searches which work for publishers.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>If you have three to five year revenue forecasts, ramp affiliate revenue down over time rather than predicting growth</strong>. The era of affiliate revenue as a major contributor will be over. Use the revenue you are getting from it to bootstrap other areas.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Heavily invest in newsletters.</strong> And whatever you do, don't consider them to be a place for advertising. Nothing creeps users out more than thinking they are signing up for interesting content only to find it chock-full of ads or sponsored content. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Don't think that AI-generated content is going to “save” you</strong>. Many publishers are looking at content created by LLMs as a way of lowering costs. It will. But it will also put you out of business. Remember that any content you can create with an LLM can be done better by Google at the top of its results pages. What publishers have in their favour is human talent, creativity and expertise. The more you lose that by trying to use LLMs to cut costs, the smaller your competitive advantage.</p></li>\n</ol><!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph --><p>Next week I will return to that last topic, and look at the mirage of LLM content and why it's a death-trap for publishers. </p><!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:jetpack/subscriptions /-->\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<p>It would take a far, far longer post than I’m prepared to spend my time writing to go through Marc Andreessen’s “<a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/\">Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a>” paragraph by awful paragraph, but a few points probably won’t go amiss. - If you’re going to approvingly paraphrase “a manifesto of a different time and place”, you might want to check that said manifesto’s author wasn’t <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Tommaso_Marinetti#Marinetti_and_Fascism\">an early member of Mussolini’s fascist party</a>.</p>\n<p>- Writing “we believe technology is universalist. Technology doesn’t care about your ethnicity, race, religion, national origin, gender, sexuality, political views,” and then, two paragraphs later “We believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak” either shows you have no idea how to write, are being entirely disingenuous, or simply too stupid to think except in blocks of 240 characters. Either way, get an editor to help.</p>\n<p>- If you are going to talk about the Greek notion of <em>arete</em> then having an understanding of its relationship to class in Greek society might be a good idea, too. Aristocrats were assumed, by definition, to be exemplars of <em>arete.</em> It wasn’t something that <em>thetes</em> like me would have.</p>\n<p>- Believing that techno-optimism “is a material philosophy, <em>not</em> a political philosophy” while giving many repeated examples of what even a first year philosophy undergraduate which know was a political philosophy does not make you look smart.</p>\n<p>I could go on – the whole thing is riddled with howlers – but really is there much point?</p>\n<p>Thirty years ago, in a different life, I was a philosophy postgraduate student and taught first year undergraduates their introduction to metaphysics and ethics. In the first time, every time, someone would turn in an essay which read like this, and you would have to patiently explain to them they were going to have to rewrite it or fail, because philosophy does not mean writing down all the random thoughts you had when smoking that bundle of weed the night before the deadline.</p>\n<p>This is the manifesto of an emotionally insecure man having a mid-life crisis as he realises that his life’s work is meaningless and all the gold and treasure he has accumulated will never make him happy. Mid-life crises in men are often surprisingly redolent of the emotional outpouring of pseudo-intellectual silliness that accompany late teenage, that first period of life when boys start to realise they are not the centre of the world and lash out at the injustice of it all.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, then it’s no surprise this reads like it was written by a 14 year old and put on Pastebin. That it was written by a 52 year old with billions of dollars at his disposal says more about the failure of capitalism to imbue life with meaning than Andreessen could possibly imagine.</p>\n<p>EDIT: The first draft of this contained something about A16Z’s investment in Uber. In fact, they passed on Uber. But as if to make the point about the kind of technology which Andreessen believes will save the world as long as we never question it, let’s ask an AI...</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"Screenshot 2023-10-17 at 08.48.51.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2023/screenshot-2023-10-17-at-08.48.51.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023 10 17 at 08 48 51\" width=\"598\" height=\"297\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n",

The aim is to provide the answer to any query on the results page, not one more click away.</p>\n<p>This has massive implications for publisher traffic, particular for reviews and answers pages which I think are most vulnerable to AI-driven answers. I&rsquo;ve been using CoPilot for purchasing research and it&rsquo;s great. I can start by asking it for, say, laptops under £1000 with good battery life. I can then have a conversation to interrogate more about each product. It&rsquo;s a superior experience to any web page I have ever used for that kind of product research.</p>\n<p>Is it 100% accurate? No &ndash; but neither are a lot of reviews, particularly the kind of &ldquo;best laptop for…&rdquo; top tens that are written to hit the top of product searches on Google.</p>\n<p>But it&rsquo;s not just affiliate: search provides between 40-80% of publisher site traffic.

The aim is to provide the answer to any query on the results page, not one more click away. \n\nThis has massive implications for publisher traffic, particular for reviews and answers pages which I think are most vulnerable to AI-driven answers. I've been using CoPilot for purchasing research and it's great. I can start by asking it for, say, laptops under £1000 with good battery life. I can then have a conversation to interrogate more about each product. It's a superior experience to any web page I have ever used for that kind of product research.\n\nIs it 100% accurate? No -- but neither are a lot of reviews, particularly the kind of \"best laptop for…\" top tens that are written to hit the top of product searches on Google. \n\nBut it's not just affiliate: search provides between 40-80% of publisher site traffic.

That's just not possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's been a relatively quiet week. On Tuesday I was going to go to Waterstones in Canterbury to see Mark Stay talk about his latest book, but didn't feel great so I stayed at home. I suspect the reason I didn't feel great was basically that I didn't have enough caffeine: I accidentally made morning coffee with decaf, which is probably some kind of crime against humanity. Coffee-drinking humanity, at least.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On Thursday I went to the Good Bad Books event at the Barbican. We drove in, which is crazy, but even taking into account the charge for ULEZ and petrol costs it's half the price of the train. The prices of train journeys, even bought in advance, off-peak and discounted, are stupid. Once you have more than a single person, it's probably cheaper to drive if you can, even though fuel prices are again on the up. I hate it, but there it is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The event was the culmination of a series of workshops. I went to the last one on horror writing and the story I wrote got selected to go in the book produced for the event, which was INCREDIBLY EXCITING. I have had my byline in so many magazines I've lost count, and probably had a million words published, but none of them have been fiction and that's incredibly exciting. I didn't even think it was that good a story, although I'm told otherwise -- so I'll take it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This was also a week of computer maintenance, and I'm not even vaguely finished. The autumn new operating system bonanza -- new versions of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Windows and even Chrome OS -- meant that a lot of machines suddenly wanted to download multi-gigabyte updates. Which would be fine if our home broadband ran at anything other than glacial speeds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cue me carting around various laptops to the University Library, where I can sit and update things at much faster speeds. And of course read some really good books. Having a borrower's ticket, though, is turning out not to be much of a money saver as I have a tendency to want to buy some of the books I find. Thankfully they are mostly second hand, obscure and cheap.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One other small good piece of tech this week: it turns out there is a version of iA Writer for Windows, which makes me very happy indeed. iA Writer is a <em>great</em> Markdown programme which includes some great editing features, such as the ability to highlight all the verbs, nouns, adverbs and so on in different colours. This makes it really easy to spot where you are being repetitive or where the adverbs are taking over the text.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And finally, Saturday saw us pop along to the Gulbenkian to see Acid Brass – acid house, played by a proper brass band. I first saw them 26 years ago, at the Barbican performance of KLF's <em>Fuck the Millennium</em> – a gig which lasted (if I remember) 24 minutes (there was some numerological connection to the number which Jimmy and Bill were obsessed with). There was dancing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things things which caught my attention this week</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngZ0K3lWKRc\">This video</a> shows a meeting between the legendary Hayao Miyazaki, who made some of the most beautiful animated films in history, and a bunch of AI dudes keen to show him their generative movement system.

They're a fascinating bunch: from the older ones (Brian Aldiss, J. G. Ballard) to the young punks (Michael Moorcock, M. John Harrison) there was a lot of really interesting stuff going on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have also started re-reading Malcolm Bradbury's <em>The History Man</em>, which I first watched in television form (starring Anthony Sher) when I was a teenager. It was one of the things which persuaded me that maybe I should go to polytechnic rather than sign on or work at the railway painting trains like my father. My ambitions, at that age, involved being in a band and owning a transit van to take us to gigs. My life has taken many odd turns since then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also reading – I'm going a lot of reading – <em>New Worlds: An anthology</em> edited by Moorcock from 1983. This was a library find, where I have ended up buying a second hand copy. I had this book when it first came out, and lent it to my friend Stanley. Predictably, I never got it back. Wherever you are, Stanley, give me a shout.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things I have been writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been writing some notes for a potential novel, but I'm not sure it's got legs.

The workshop that I went to last week at the Barbican on horror was the last one a series run by Good Bad Books over the summer -- I hadn't known about it till the last one, otherwise I would have been to all of them -- and they were taking submissions from attendees for a chapbook of work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, the submission date was Wednesday which basically gave me two days to write and edit something. I <em>could</em> have simply pulled an idea off the shelf, or even taking a preexisting piece. But I wanted to do something based on the exercises in the workshop, so I was essentially almost working from a fragment which was never really intended to be a full story.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I got it done. Submissions had to be less than 1000 words, and mine was about 750. It had a beginning, a middle and an end.

It was part of a series of workshops run by the <a href=\"https://fieldnotes.site/\">Fieldnotes group</a> across southern England aiming to explore creative practice situated in place, and there is definitely something interesting and inspiring about moving from location to location while exploring some prompts for creative work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We ended in the best possible fashion: a cup of tea and slice of cake at the <a href=\"https://www.thecriterionbluetown.co.uk/\">Criterion Bluetown Heritage Centre</a>. This is a brilliant small museum and music hall which is doing a huge amount to preserve the history of Sheppey and Bluetown in particular. Once a cramped working class district created to serve the docks, Bluetown housed thousands of people thanks to the adjacent docks, which made workers live within a mile. Now there are only about 200 people living in Bluetown. It's fascinating -- and outside of the island (and even on it) a lot of this history is invisible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week also saw the arrival of two new bits of technology. The first was a 2TB internal SSD, which I fitted into my ThinkPad X1 Carbon – which means it now has 32GB RAM and enough storage to last quite a while. It's mainly a Linux machine these days which means it is massively over-specced, but the performance is really good and I like using it.

There wasn’t anything there which made me want to rush out and buy a new watch or phone – I’m happy with what I’ve got, and I suspect that the next time I buy a phone it will be something more repairable like the <a href=\"https://shop.fairphone.com/fairphone-5\">Fairphone 5</a> rather than another iPhone. I’m somewhat done with glued together devices which end up being shredded when all that’s wrong with them is a broken port. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One Wednesday I had a session with my coach, which sounds a lot more la-de-dah than it actually is. Since leaving Bauer, I have had a few sessions with her to look at the kind of work that I want to do in the future, starting with working on what my values are. I’m past the point where I’m going to hold my nose and commit myself to a permanent relationship with a company that doesn’t share my values. We also took a long look at what I’m actually good at <strong>and</strong> how that relates to what I enjoy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All this is stuff that you just don’t get much time to think about when you’re in a full-time job, so it’s been good to have the time to do it. Fundamentally, I’m good at leading teams through difficult times, whether that’s a change of strategy, structure, management or just a changing market. I’m good at getting people pointed in the right direction, and understanding the emotional needs they have – if you understand what people’s emotional needs are, it’s a lot easy to get them performing as part of a team. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We often discuss processes and structures and all the “scientific” bit of leadership, but we often forget that people are driven as much by their emotions as their rationality.

Mum passed away a few years ago, but she would have been 92, which sounds all kinds of weird. I know I’ll never stop missing her, no matter how old I get.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yesterday I was back in London at a <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2023/event/horror-with-hardeep-pandhal-and-david-steans\">workshop</a> about horror writing with <a href=\"https://lux.org.uk/artist/hardeep-pandhal/\">Hardeep Pandai</a> and <a href=\"https://www.davidsteans.com\">David Steans</a>, which was fascinating. One thing which came out is the relationship between horror and comedy. I think the archetype of this is Iain Banks’ magnificent first novel, <em>The Wasp Factory.</em> It’s a colossally horrific book (The Irish Times memorably described it as “a work of unparalleled depravity”) but also filled with black humour, and in some ways the humour acts to draw the reader in. There’s part of everyone that loves Frank Cauldhame because he’s just <em>funny</em> and the things he does are as much baroque comedy as horror.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve always thought that <em>The Wasp Factory</em> is a massively underrated book. While people still talk about Brett Easton Ellis’ <em>American Psycho</em>, Banks’ book is overshadowed by his later science fiction work and some of his more literary novels. In some ways, I don’t think Iain wrote a more perfect book, and if I ever write something that’s even a tenth as affecting, I’ll be a very lucky human.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>Things I have been reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m slowly trudging my way through Neal Asher’s <em>War Bodies,</em> having given up on it after about 20 pages. If I were sensible, I would just drop it, but I hate not finishing books – it’s a bad habit to get into – and I’m determined to get to the end. It’s not that it’s bad, or at least not as bad as I thought after 20 pages. But it’s pretty clear that Neal has run out of road with the “Polity universe” it’s set it. Of course, when you have a universe that readers love, it’s all too tempting to go back into it for both creative (there’s always something else to explore) and commercial (publishers will want you to do it) reasons. But sometimes things run their course, and I think the Polity is done.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would really love Neal to go back and write something more around the universe of <em>Cowl,</em> though. I think that’s his best book, with one of the best ideas around time travel I have ever read. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>Things I have been writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wrote a piece of micro-fiction about a man who turns himself into a crab, which is about as bizarre as it sounds. I also started some notes about a story which involves Greek mythology, werewolves, and some interesting mystery elements. What’s fascinating is that I don’t know yet how its genre might play out: the background I’ve started writing could easily flex to being a weird crime novel or a straightforward horror. More work required before I actually start writing (which is always what I’m tempted to do!)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also wrote something about how the recently released <a href=\"https://technovia.co.uk/2023/09/15/properties-in-obsidian.html\">properties feature in Obsidian</a> could end up a game changer for how it can be used. I’ve got a much longer post about the plugins I use for Obsidian to make it a good environment for writing, which just needs an intro writing before it’s ready to be published.

Unfortunately, these reports were completely wrong. </p>\n\n<p>All that the government did was acknowledge that Ofcom, the body which would issue notices to companies requiring them to scan their networks, could only do so if it was technically possible – in other words, that it would be pointless to attempt to demand companies do something they physically couldn’t. This is clear in the quote from Lord Stephen Parkinson, the minister responsible, in the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/770e58b1-a299-4b7b-a129-bded8649a43b\">original FT story</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“A notice can only be issued where technically feasible and where technology has been accredited as meeting minimum standards of accuracy in detecting only child sexual abuse and exploitation content,” he said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is a long way from a government retreat. And as it stands, the clauses requiring companies to endanger their users privacy and security remain in the bill. </p>\n\n<p>The government has now confirmed this, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/uk-minister-says-position-encryption-not-changed-2023-09-07/\">Michelle Donelan, the technology minister, saying</a> saying: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We haven’t changed the bill at all… If there was a situation where the mitigations that the social media providers are taking are not enough, and if after further work with the regulator they still can’t demonstrate that they can meet the requirements within the bill, then the conversation about technology around encryption takes place,” she said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the government is claiming it’s all technologically feasible:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>She said further work to develop the technology was needed, but added that <em>government-funded research had shown it was possible</em>. (My emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The government is not backing down. It believes it’s possible technically, and <strong>will</strong> attempt to make companies comply. It will do this in secrecy, and it doesn’t give a damn about the privacy or security of the British people. The fight is not over. </p>\n",

When I started writing this post I had to check my calendar to see what I have done this week, and found that events I thought have happened the previous one had, in fact, been within the last seven days.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's partly down to Kim being away, and partly due to not working. When you don't have the rhythm of work, you lose one of the main things which anchor you in time. There is a pace, a way of being, which is set for you and that you don't have to consider. All of which is a challenge to me: while I am not working, I need to reestablish that pattern.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And yet this week has been pretty full. Monday, of course, was a bank holiday -- and what do you do on a bank holiday other than go to the seaside? Myself and my friend Edward headed down to Margate for a bit of a mooch around. It was surprisingly quiet, much more like a regular Sunday than a Bank Holiday Monday, which is probably not great for the local traders. I have heard that the great post-pandemic British seaside boom was over, but this was the first time I saw it with my own eyes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On Tuesday I went into London to catch up with an old colleague, deep in the heart of News UK. It's an impressive building -- and it was good to have a chat to someone who was both a big influence and a good mate. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After that I went to the V&amp;A to see the <em>Diva</em> exhibition, which I would absolutely recommend. And it's the first exhibition I have been to where I think there's a benefit to having the proffered headphones: divas definitely need a soundtrack, all the way from Victorians to today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The V&amp;A is one of my favourite places in London. I became a member there quite a few years ago, and would occasionally sneak off work for an afternoon's \"inspiration\" there, sitting looking at lovely things, clearing my head and writing stuff in my notebook. It's one of the things I miss about London: there is space like that in Canterbury, and few enough in Kent as a whole.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The rest of the week was taken up with bumbling around, washing, and generally wasting of time. I spent a chunk of time working on setting up Obsidian to make it a better environment for writing, experimenting with plugins which let you do things like post directly to Micro.blog, make your use of Markdown and punctuation more consistent, and so on.

What's fascinating is how this has changed from (in the UK) largely pension funds to foreign investors, and what that means for the governance of our largest companies. the shift from mostly individual investors to mostly pension funds had a big impact on the way companies saw themselves, and who they saw as the important people to serve, and this change to being owned by people who largely have no particular interest in the health of UK society is also an important one.  </li>\n</ol>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>Things I have been writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm writing a big blog post on how I have customised <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> for writing.

Many of the things that I tend to do when Kim is at home turn out to be less attractive when I’m on my own for a longer period. For example, TV: I’ve watched almost nothing this week, which is unusual for someone who grew up nursemaided by the television.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>(This is true.

Since I stopped working my coffee intake has done up. Although I don’t drink any after 5pm it’s rare that I have less than six cups through the day, which is a lot. Enough, in fact, to make the symptoms of caffeine withdrawal bad. If you have never had a caffeine withdrawal it’s a reminder that it’s a physically addictive drug: for me, it manifests as a headache which nothing will shift, plus nausea. There’s nothing you can do except ride it out by lying down in a darkened room. Not nice</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So of course I went out and got coffee.

A bunch of SEO types Germain interviewed swear by it, but they believe in a lot of really bizarre stuff. It sounds like nonsense to me. After all, Google also prioritizes authority, and a well-known website which has chronicled the history of an industry for decades is pretty damn impressive. Why would “a 1996 article about available AOL service tiers” — per the internal memo — cause a negative effect on the site’s rankings, anyhow? I cannot think of a good reason why a news site purging its archives makes any sense whatsoever.</blockquote>\nThere’s been quite a kerfuffle about this.

In legal cases, it's usually the team which makes the fewest mistakes that wins -- and Starmer is aiming to do exactly that, removing every possible attack line of the Tories with things like his criticism of Sadiq Khan's ULEZ policy.

It's simply untenable to have the largest browser in the hands of the largest web advertising firm.\" Plus of course it's the largest source of traffic to pretty-much every web site on the planet, and the owner of the most widely-used smartphone operating system, and the only game in town for web video creators (forget it TikTok, you know your creators want to \"graduate\" to a YouTube channel).

After six years, I’m leaving Bauer and moving got to pastures new – or at least to allow myself some time to do some more creative work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I haven’t really talked much about work here as I prefer to compartmentalise it, and because the actual amount that I can talk about is usually quite limited. But I have been director of content and audience development there, and although I’ve loved the work and the people, the amount of opportunity that I have had to be creative has been limited. I have mostly been <em>managing</em> people, and although I’m good at that and find it rewarding, it has left an itch which I have needed to scratch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have written before about how I’ve been scratching that itch with creative writing, but combining that with a day job which really does take a lot of energy has been difficult.

I don’t know how far I can get with this – and I definitely don’t know if there’s any kind of “career” there – but having the space and time to try seems like an opportunity which doesn’t come along often. I don’t think I’m quite in the same position as Lee Child, who famously got made redundant and <a href=\"https://blog.nls.uk/james-dover-grant-becomes-bestselling-author-lee-child/\">gave himself six months to write a bestseller</a>, but I would like to explore if this is something I want to do more of.

Leaving MacUser was mostly about feeling burned out and wanting an easier life. I was living in Brighton and the commute up to London – which I was doing every day – was taxing. I knew I could make a decent living freelancing, and I did. Leaving Redwood was easy, as after eight years in the world of contract publishing, the chance to move back to Dennis felt like a good one. And leaving Dennis was also an obvious move, as I was going to a bigger company and a bigger role, working with some of the best brands in the world across publishing and radio.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This feels a bit more like that first time because I genuinely don’t know exactly what the future holds yet. But I know that, really, it has to be <strong>now</strong>. I’m 56, which means another fifteen years or so before I can retire. If I stayed much longer at Bauer, it would be the last place I ever worked. And I don’t feel like I want to work anywhere for what would have ended up as 23 years if I had stayed. While my dad was content to work for British Rail for 44 years (literally man and boy, as he started there when he was 14) that’s just not for me. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So here I am.

Support for ActivityPub, which would allow you to follow Threads users from Mastodon, isn’t there yet. There’s no web interface, which means the only way to post from the desktop is to use the Android app running on the Windows Android Subsystem (I presume it works with ChromeOS’ equivalent). You can’t run the iOS app on Apple Silicon Macs, either. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most egregious for an app which is spun out of an image platform, there’s support for alt text. This should have been there from the start, no excuses.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It feels like it’s really 2-3 weeks away from launch, but Meta obviously saw a window of opportunity thanks to the last few days chaos on Twitter and decided to push the big red button. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>I’m not seeing much to worry Mastodon users</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having seen it and read what Eugen has to say I don’t think the sky is falling in for Mastodon. It will be cool to be able to follow people who exist in a Threads world from my Mastodon account. I’ll have the advantage too of a straightforward chronological feed. Which leads me to…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>The feed was a mess at the start, but it got better fast</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The feed is clearly algorithmic (and I would say that it really needs a chronological option). There were a lot of complaints about the number of posts from people you didn’t follow in the feed from very early adopters. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Break it down, though, and that’s entirely to be expected. You might <em>follow</em> lots of people but early on they may not even have actually been registered – it effectively flagged anyone you followed on Instagram so that when they registered for Threads, you followed them. And of the people who created accounts, many didn’t post much to start.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So Meta did what Meta does: it gave you something fresh to look at, every time you refreshed your feed or opened the app. Hence, lots of posts from people you don’t follow that the algorithm thought you might be interested in, based on almost no data.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first my feed was <strong>horrible</strong>. It’s now fine, and unless I do some doom refreshing all I see is people I follow. If you judged it from the first ten seconds you saw your feed, you really should calm down a little. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>Twitter is dead, dead, dead</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Within 24 hours on Threads you can find most politicians, media brands, celebrities and sports teams. A lot of what made Twitter good for the kind of ordinary person was being able to connect to and talk about that things – and Twitter was the only platform you could do that, other than Instagram. Now you can connect with all the same people, with text posts. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Less than 24 hours in, Threads has 30m users – it could eclipse Twitter’s scale in a month or too. There is just no reason for Twitter to exist now. It’s just Gab with a couple of hundred million dormant accounts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>There are some serious tests of moderation capabilities ahead</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Which leads us nicely on to moderation, and there are many tests of the skills of Meta’s moderation teams and policies to come. Already, some of the most horrible abusive accounts like LibsOfTikTok are on the platform. Is Meta going to ban them when they start spewing hatred and encouraging violence? Zuckerberg has spoken about Threads being a “kind” platform. If he really means that, they are going to have to come down on accounts like LibsOfTikTok hard and fast. We shall see. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>The future for Bluesky is not that bright</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unfortunately we can probably consign the likes of T2 and Post to the “where are they now?” file of 2024. Which leaves Bluesky, which recently opened up invites and got quite a few more people in. It had also been pretty vibrant last weekend, when Twitter was melting down – I think that was the last straw for quite a few people.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think Bluesky is dead. It has some nice technical ideas – shared blocklists, feeds you can programme yourself – but the whole idea of building this on a new, alternative protocol rather than using ActivityPub has meant it’s been trying to tap-dance and unicycle at the same time. It’s been too much, it’s slowed down its ability to scale up, and it probably means it’s missed its window. Those two technical sweeties are outweighed by the fact that most people I know are already on Threads, and I don’t have to search for them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>I quite like it</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wasn’t expecting to like Threads, but I do – or rather I like being connected to friends, old colleagues and family on a text-based social network. I like being able to follow the odd team, celeb, brand or politician. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don’t hate the algorithm, although I would prefer to be able to default to reverse chronological. When ActivityPub support arrives, I’ll probably just follow a bunch of people on Threads from my Mastodon account, so I get to use a reverse chronological feed and use the powerful filters you have there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s a lot for Meta to do to make it really work, but it’s a good solid start. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I am mostly what Matt Gemmell calls a pantser – I start writing and see where it goes – which means I get to a point in a piece of work and have no idea where to go with it next. It’s probably why I prefer writing short-form fiction to long-form: the plot is easy and very self-contained when you’re writing something short. Tim’s book is definitely helping cure me of that. A bit. Maybe.

Brenda was <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/royal-family/king-charles-coronation-queen-elizabeth-b2332397.html\">at the coronation of the late queen</a>, and is a treasure house of memories as well as being a lovely, delightful person to be around.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After leaving Brenda's house on Saturday we decided to stop off in Manchester's gay village to have a look (I haven't been there for a couple of decades, and Kim never has) and a quick pint. We ended up of course chatting to a lovely bunch of young boys (they were all in their early 20s so very much boys to me), and a very very drunk and emotional girl, plus a couple of older men in television. Five pints and a jelly shot (bought by one of the boys) later we broke my \"no Uber\" rule because we were too drunk to work out how to get back to our hotel on the tram.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Related: I fucking love trams.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also just love Manchester, a city on the scale of London but without the feeling which I get from the capital of things having been closed down, unavailable unless you have vast amounts of money or are a property developer.

But ActivityPub ≠ Mastodon, and services can adopt an open protocol without committing to use it to connect to anyone and everyone on the planet using the same protocol. Gab uses ActivityPub (and no one connects to Gab), and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/about\">a quick view of the average block list for any instance</a> should be enough to show that interoperability is limited by social norms as well as technical ones. Tristan's point is doubly nonsensical seeing as BlueSky's AT protocol isn't even out yet, so Meta couldn't use it even if it wanted to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What defines Mastodon is not the use of a protocol. The protocol is just an enabler. Instead, Mastodon is defined by allowing communities (instances) freedom of association. <strong>It is the ability of communities to choose not to federate with anyone else which gives Mastodon its strength.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mastodon is not a social network, which is where I think John and Dare start from. It's a set of communities which may, or may not, choose to connect to each other. Those relationships are based on shared values and trust: my instance connects to yours because I trust you to moderate effectively, not allow spam, or whatever other ground rules we can agree on. Some communities choose to apply this loosely, and some more strictly (some communities, for example, won't federate with others who don't have the same expectations around moderation for everyone they federate with).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For some marginal communities the freedom of association which Mastodon is based on is the difference between having a space that's safe for them to express themselves and not having a space at all. It's not about having the biggest possible audience – it's about being able to share in a semi-public way with other trusted communities.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Freedom of association is the foundational human right and Mastodon is the only service I know of which prioritises it over everything else. That's what makes it important – and arguments like Dare's, which claim that if you use an open protocol you lose that right, are just wildly off-base.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Federating with an instance isn’t just about letting individuals connect to individuals</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you want to understand why some communities are wary of Meta, it's worth remembering how ActivityPub works. Let's say I run an instance called EvilMole.social. If I don't defederate (block) Meta's server, any user on their server and any user on EvilMole can follow each other. So suppose that @molesworth@evilmole.social follows @billy@meta.social. What happens?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, every single one of Molesworth's posts are now available to Meta, including <strong>all</strong> the replies they make to everyone <strong>including people who don't follow anyone on Meta's server.</strong> In other words, Meta gets access to posts from people who may very well have an issue with that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It’s not (just) about anti-capitalism</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>John's question is whether \"the goal of the Fediverse to be anti-corporate/anti-commercial, or to be pro-openness\" is simply a false dichotomy, because resistance to Meta is based on its past behaviour, not simply anti-capitalism.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just for the record, I definitely <strong>am</strong> an anti-capitalist, and I look forward to the day when something more equitable takes over. But you don't have to be an anti-capitalist to believe that Meta, in particular, is not worthy of even a shred of trust</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember that federating with a Meta service means handing over post data even for posts which are not directly towards a user on their servers. For marginalised and vulnerable communities in particular, keeping data out of Meta's hands can be a priority. It's not that long since the company was <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/facebook-meta-pixel-tracking-websites-abortion-services-185249977.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGR1QSBMQuoIEWBztpPcg7-0cMJj3MsBQqjfZw-Tlwa4r9bhQpxigj7JDemhyI8rgXMsvlH3f0TdjI8Zp3DA1ADGsAeQGa_BH0owdToyzEPNapanOM8D38XfL2wTw1b9j9q0aLsKPLx5klSk6q4QeJie6XXhfpIecDxv1GMMcT-T&amp;guccounter=2\">tracking people seeking information about abortions</a>, allowing advertisers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/10/facebook-bans-ads-targeting-race-sexual-orientation-and-religion\">target based on sexual orientation</a>, and, of course, <a href=\"https://xtramagazine.com/power/facebook-meta-profiting-off-transphobic-documentary-237936\">making millions of dollars off the back of a transphobic \"documentary\"</a>. The idea that Meta can be trusted with yet more data to harvest is pretty naive at best. For some communities, pre-emptively blocking Meta is entirely appropriate given its track record.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Claiming that a commitment to openness requires giving Meta access to your posts, that you somehow <strong>must</strong> cooperate with them or allow them into your community is another of those occasions when it's obvious that someone doesn't understand that freedom of association also includes the ability to choose not to associate – and that freedom of association is, if anything, an even more important right than freedom of speech. It's the freedom not to have to listen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>(As an aside, it's interesting to me that American commentators ofter seem to prioritise freedom of speech over freedom of association. Perhaps this is because, while freedom of speech is an explicit part of the 1st Amendment, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association#United_States_Constitution\">freedom of association is not</a> – it was only with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP_v._Alabama\">NAACP vs Alabama</a> in 1958 that freedom of association became a recognised right on the basis of its necessity for both free speech and due process. Meanwhile, in Europe, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_11_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights)%20under%20the%20European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights\">freedom of association is a separate protected right</a>.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The email analogy is terrible, and we should all stop using it</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>John – and many others – often cite email as an example of \"big companies running big instances and not extinguishing the openness that made the platform great\". There's a bunch of problems with this, but the biggest is that in fact email is a perfect example of how \"open\" platforms can become dominated by large corporations and effectively lock others out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Email runs on open protocols, so it's technically possible for me to run a server on my Mac mini upstairs and start sending and receiving mail. The reality, though, is that virtually none of the mail I send would get through – because Gmail, Microsoft, et al would mark it as suspicious and end up automatically blocked as spam.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Blocklists for email exist and are shared across services – and blocking is often pre-emptive, not based on suspicious behaviour of that server. Sure, email is an open set of protocols, but it's also highly restricted by large companies and not at all open to either smaller providers or individuals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This isn't just an abstract issue: I know of friends who have had to abandon email servers they ran themselves, sometime literally on a box in the corner of a home office, because the big corporations that dominate email simply wouldn't deliver anything they send.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>John – and everyone commenting on this – must also know the history of how companies use open protocols as a method of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish\">embrace, extend and extinguish</a>\" – but since the Microsoft era they have learned that they don't need to extinguish, just extend in ways which make it incredibly hard for anyone to compete. The canonical example of this for me is how Google has used Chrome to influence the web and its protocols, in such a way as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16805216/google-chrome-only-sites-internet-explorer-6-web-standards\">\"Chrome-only sites\" now being a thing</a>. It's incredibly naive to think that openness automatically makes things better when you have companies totally willing to exploit that openness to dominate a market.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I think it’s only now, with the benefit of two years of processing, that I’m really able to think and write about covid and the lockdowns of March 2020 onwards. And it’s only now that I have started to feel like life has really resumed, that I’m able to just go out and do things: see art, go to talks, listen to live music. In the last few months, something has resumed. It’s not my old life, but it is something.</p>\n<p>There was that amazingly strange moment in time when everyone was effectively housebound, confined in a way which no British population in history had been before. You couldn’t drive anywhere unless it was to get to essential work, or to shop – and if you did shop, only one person from a household was allowed to go unless there were extenuating circumstances. You could leave the house to exercise, for as long as you wanted, but only meeting the people within your household. Friends and strangers alike had to be kept at a distance. If someone was coming your way, you crossed the road to avoid them.</p>\n<p>Before lockdown there was a period when everyone knew it was coming but everyone wanted to believe that washing your hands for 20 seconds was the solution. It hit us early. On the 13th March – naturally a Friday – one of our friends came from London for a visit. By Sunday, he was sick enough for us to have to drive him home, with rumours swirling that London would enter a lockdown which might see no one able to come in or out of it.</p>\n<p>By Wednesday 18th March I was sick too. A minor cough, but what made me know it was covid was the exhaustion. It took me 30 minutes to write a five line email to my manager at work, telling her I thought I had covid, because I barely had the strength to type. Then Kim was sick. There were no tests available: the few PCR tests were going to hospitals. If you got sick, you just had to wait and hope it didn’t get bad enough for you to need an ambulance, breathing apparatus, intubation, critical care.</p>\n<p>And the following Monday, 23rd March 2020, everyone was ordered to stay in their homes.</p>\n<p>In lockdown, one weekend we walked from our home up on Tyler Hill in Canterbury down to one of the city centre parks because we had heard a rumour that there was a stall still selling takeaway coffee due to some kind of loophole in the regulations. A two mile walk to get a cappuccino. I almost cried – it was the first time in weeks that I had felt that somehow, perhaps, things might get better.</p>\n<p>Lockdown has affected everything. I look at the fashions of the young people at university – kids who spent nearly two crucial years barely able to socialise with their friends except online – and they wear the kind of clothes that everyone adopts when they don’t have to leave the house: baggy sportswear, shapeless and comfortable, with none of the effort or styling which usually moulds your appearance at that age. It’s a bland conformity driven not by the surrounding culture but by a lack of surrounding culture. Humans are social animals: when that sociability turns into something which might kill them, they suffer.</p>\n<p>And everyone I know has suffered in one way or another. Social bonds, prematurely loosened to the point of breakage. Friendships that took a hiatus during lockdown and have never returned. Mental health which means you struggle around strangers, or desperately seek the company of someone, anyone, while finding company strangely unrewarding.</p>\n<p>No one feels like they did. And I don’t know anyone who feels they used the experience of lockdown and changed for the better. I know plenty of people for whom that was an intention: lockdown as a time to stop, a time to reinvent themselves, a time to study and take the time to read. But I don’t know anyone who came out of it more healthy or wise than they went into it.</p>\n<p>I worry about kids. I know it’s possible to recover from badly disrupted schooling and from mental health issues in childhood (I went through it) but this is different. This was a mass trauma and I think we are, as always underestimating quite what an effect it will have both on individuals and our whole society. Children are more resilient than the mythologisers of childhood innocence would believe, but they are also more vulnerable than the stiff-upper-lip brigade fantasise about.</p>\n<p>Covid isn’t over. While the rhetoric of “learning to live with covid” has been used as an ideological figleaf for a government policy of ignoring it and pretending it didn’t happen the truth is that we **do ** have to learn to live with it. It’s not going away and the wise course of action would be to put as many mitigations in place to prevent future outbreaks as possible. Better ventilation in buildings, encouraging wearing masks (as the Japanese always have) when you feel even slightly under the weather, and of course a consistent public campaign of booster vaccination could all play a part in ensuring that we never have to go through a lockdown again.</p>\n<p>Our current government, which made a policy platform out of ignoring the consequences of Brexit are of course uniquely unsuited to doing any of this. They are born chancers, riding gamblers’ luck with our futures and our lives. They would rather believe something will come along to make covid go away entirely – or that they can do nothing and it will be someone else’s problem if and when it returns in strength.</p>\n<p>I said earlier that only now has my old life resumed, but that does not mean I am unchanged. I’m in worse physical shape than I was pre-lockdown (and I wasn’t in great shape then). Perhaps connected to having had two bouts of covid, I came out of it with significantly higher blood pressure than I went in, and weighing a fair chunk more. Lack of mobility when I work from home means that, unless I deliberately exercise, my average steps per day hovers down at the 4,000 level rather than over 10,000, which was where it was “in the before times”.</p>\n<p>My mental health suffered too, in ways which it’s hard to put my finger on. I am more anxious (and I was no stranger to anxiety). But I have also become more aware of my own needs in terms of people. Far from being the one who didn’t need a lot of people around him to, it turns out that I do, that I love being around people and function best when I am. Who would have predicted that I am, in fact, a thoroughly social animal – a perfect exemplar of how most of my fellow humans are?</p>\n<p>It also radicalised me. Covid, and the government’s response to it, exposed the middle ground of politics for what it always was: a comforting lie, something that I wanted to believe was true because I always like to believe everyone has people’s best interests at heart. During lockdown, the capitalists and their cronies came out of the woodwork in droves to dip their snouts in the trough of government money, with chancers (or “entrepreneurs”, in Toryspeak) appearing to sell us billions of pounds of useless PPE, growing fat on margins.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think it’s only now, with the benefit of two years of processing, that I’m really able to think and write about covid and the lockdowns of March 2020 onwards. And it’s only now that I have started to feel like life has really resumed, that I’m able to just go out and do things: see art, go to talks, listen to live music. In the last few months, something has resumed. It’s not my old life, but it is something.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There was that amazingly strange moment in time when everyone was effectively housebound, confined in a way which no British population in history had been before. You couldn’t drive anywhere unless it was to get to essential work, or to shop – and if you did shop, only one person from a household was allowed to go unless there were extenuating circumstances. You could leave the house to exercise, for as long as you wanted, but only meeting the people within your household. Friends and strangers alike had to be kept at a distance. If someone was coming your way, you crossed the road to avoid them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before lockdown there was a period when everyone knew it was coming but everyone wanted to believe that washing your hands for 20 seconds was the solution. It hit us early. On the 13th March – naturally a Friday – one of our friends came from London for a visit. By Sunday, he was sick enough for us to have to drive him home, with rumours swirling that London would enter a lockdown which might see no one able to come in or out of it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By Wednesday 18th March I was sick too. A minor cough, but what made me know it was covid was the exhaustion. It took me 30 minutes to write a five line email to my manager at work, telling her I thought I had covid, because I barely had the strength to type. Then Kim was sick. There were no tests available: the few PCR tests were going to hospitals. If you got sick, you just had to wait and hope it didn’t get bad enough for you to need an ambulance, breathing apparatus, intubation, critical care.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the following Monday, 23rd March 2020, everyone was ordered to stay in their homes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In lockdown, one weekend we walked from our home up on Tyler Hill in Canterbury down to one of the city centre parks because we had heard a rumour that there was a stall still selling takeaway coffee due to some kind of loophole in the regulations. A two mile walk to get a cappuccino. I almost cried – it was the first time in weeks that I had felt that somehow, perhaps, things might get better. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lockdown has affected everything. I look at the fashions of the young people at university – kids who spent nearly two crucial years barely able to socialise with their friends except online – and they wear the kind of clothes that everyone adopts when they don’t have to leave the house: baggy sportswear, shapeless and comfortable, with none of the effort or styling which usually moulds your appearance at that age. It’s a bland conformity driven not by the surrounding culture but by a lack of surrounding culture. Humans are social animals: when that sociability turns into something which might kill them, they suffer. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And everyone I know has suffered in one way or another. Social bonds, prematurely loosened to the point of breakage. Friendships that took a hiatus during lockdown and have never returned. Mental health which means you struggle around strangers, or desperately seek the company of someone, anyone, while finding company strangely unrewarding. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No one feels like they did. And I don’t know anyone who feels they used the experience of lockdown and changed for the better. I know plenty of people for whom that was an intention: lockdown as a time to stop, a time to reinvent themselves, a time to study and take the time to read. But I don’t know anyone who came out of it more healthy or wise than they went into it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I worry about kids. I know it’s possible to recover from badly disrupted schooling and from mental health issues in childhood (I went through it) but this is different. This was a mass trauma and I think we are, as always underestimating quite what an effect it will have both on individuals and our whole society. Children are more resilient than the mythologisers of childhood innocence would believe, but they are also more vulnerable than the stiff-upper-lip brigade fantasise about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Covid isn’t over. While the rhetoric of “learning to live with covid” has been used as an ideological figleaf for a government policy of ignoring it and pretending it didn’t happen the truth is that we <strong>do </strong> have to learn to live with it. It’s not going away and the wise course of action would be to put as many mitigations in place to prevent future outbreaks as possible. Better ventilation in buildings, encouraging wearing masks (as the Japanese always have) when you feel even slightly under the weather, and of course a consistent public campaign of booster vaccination could all play a part in ensuring that we never have to go through a lockdown again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our current government, which made a policy platform out of ignoring the consequences of Brexit are of course uniquely unsuited to doing any of this. They are born chancers, riding gamblers’ luck with our futures and our lives. They would rather believe something will come along to make covid go away entirely – or that they can do nothing and it will be someone else’s problem if and when it returns in strength.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I said earlier that only now has my old life resumed, but that does not mean I am unchanged. I’m in worse physical shape than I was pre-lockdown (and I wasn’t in great shape then). Perhaps connected to having had two bouts of covid, I came out of it with significantly higher blood pressure than I went in, and weighing a fair chunk more. Lack of mobility when I work from home means that, unless I deliberately exercise, my average steps per day hovers down at the 4,000 level rather than over 10,000, which was where it was “in the before times”. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My mental health suffered too, in ways which it’s hard to put my finger on. I am more anxious (and I was no stranger to anxiety). But I have also become more aware of my own needs in terms of people. Far from being the one who didn’t need a lot of people around him to, it turns out that I do, that I love being around people and function best when I am. Who would have predicted that I am, in fact, a thoroughly social animal – a perfect exemplar of how most of my fellow humans are? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It also radicalised me. Covid, and the government’s response to it, exposed the middle ground of politics for what it always was: a comforting lie, something that I wanted to believe was true because I always like to believe everyone has people’s best interests at heart. During lockdown, the capitalists and their cronies came out of the woodwork in droves to dip their snouts in the trough of government money, with chancers (or “entrepreneurs”, in Toryspeak) appearing to sell us billions of pounds of useless PPE, growing fat on margins. Profiteering shits of the kind which appear in any disaster, but which our “third way” centralist politics pretended had gone away.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Health workers who were clapped in the streets, then denied a decent wage once it was “all over”. Bus and train staff who were lauded as “key workers” in the pandemic and made to risk their lives so that people could continue to do vital work, only to be told they were greedy when they dared to ask for their salaries to rise in line with inflation. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The old histories always made out that great men make the times. But that’s nonsense. The times make us, and they also show us a little bit of what we really are. We have to live through whatever life throws at us, and the events around us shape us to a far greater degree than we like to admit. Covid, those two years of seclusion and loss, are going to be with us for a very long time.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s been a lot of London this week. I’m doing a stint of training sessions for various teams across the business – eight sessions this week, basically two a day – and I prefer to do them from the office so I was in for four days running. The good bit is that I get a later train in (the sessions start at 11, so I can get the 9.21) the bad bit is that it turns out commuting is quite tiring. Who knew???</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It does have some plus points. It’s nice to see people face to face, and to have those kind of serendipitous chats to your colleagues which actually drive some of the more valuable creative work. It’s good to have a proper gap between work and home. The hour on the train serves that function really well. And it’s nice to have to avoid the inevitable temptation of ill-disciplined home work, where I slide out of bed at 8.45 and am furiously typing Teams messages fifteen minutes later. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I like working at home. But I like working at home <em>on my stuff</em>, rather than the business. That, I like to keep at arms length – and the blurring of home and work life which I fought hard to resist during the pandemic is finally catching up with me. I need more discipline about that, because I have lots of other things which I want to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was <a href=\"https://twil.momorgan.com/weeknote-0020/\">reading Mo Morgan’s weeknote</a> yesterday and he mentioned switching email providers. I’m not sure if Mo is actually my doppelgänger, but I have been doing <strong>exactly</strong> the same dance this week, working on trying out Fastmail. I’m impressed with it, and I am already certain that at the end of the trial period I’ll move all my email and calendars to it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another service that I’ve been looking at this week is Authory, which I have been using and recommending for a few years. I did an interview with them about how it meets my needs and was gushingly positive. If you don’t know it, and you’re a writer on the web, you should be using it: it basically scans sites that you write for for your work and create a personal archive of it. So, when someone on the site’s audience development team decides that your old content should be redirect fodder for strengthening another article’s rankings, you don’t lose your work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>(Yes, I have done that to people’s work. I’m sorry.)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Authory has some really nice features. You can use it to create a portfolio site which has all your content from across the web on it. Or you can have an email susbcription using it, so people get all your stuff if they sign up. Oh, and if you tell it a site where your content is, it will go through and find all the existing content to preserve, which is useful when, like me, you have done a bunch of freelance work over the years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I am still getting slightly scratchy about how to set up my desk at home. A few weeks ago I exiled the Mac mini into the spare room, because although it was great it also tended to dominate the desk. I had a computer and pretty big monitor right in front of me, and it just didn’t feel right. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I moved the Mac mini and now use my MacBook Air M2. It’s on a stand at the moment, which raise it to a nice height, and I use the Keychron K2 with it which has a lovely action on it. But somehow it still seems like… a lot? Just having the laptop on the desk might be a better option, even though ergonomically I know for a fact that’s terrible. Or maybe I should just go back to having a monitor and a minimal Mac mini setup. Decisions, decisions. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yesterday we went down to Chichester and saw “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2023/may/15/kaye-donachie-song-for-the-last-act-review-pallant-house-gallery-chichester-gwen-john\">Kaye Donachie: Song for the Last Act</a>” at the Pallant House Gallery.

It’s part of the character of Sevenoaks – and tells you a lot about it as a place – that there is a large country house and deer park right next to it. Or rather, <em>in</em> it: where most maps look like cities eat away at the surrounding countryside, Sevenoaks seems like Knole has devoured part of it, the green biting a chunk from the concrete grey.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Knole is an incredibly well-preserved 17th century house and was the home of the Sackville family, who later became the Sackville-West family. Vita Sackville-West was born here, and her inability to inherit the house – denied by British primogeniture laws – was something she was bitter about her entire life. Instead, the house (and title) went to her uncle Charles, who bequeathed it to the National Trust in 1947.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>Things I have been reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I skipped a few days reading this week – there is nothing I like less than reading when I’m confined to bed ill – but I have been pressing on with Julia Armfield’s <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781529017250\">Our wives under the sea</a></em>, which I am enjoying a lot. I would love my own writing to be this accomplished. Many passages have been clipped from it, and there are times when she hits the mark with a sentence so well that it almost leaves me breathless. For example:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I see my mother in myself, though less in the sense of inherited features and more in the sense of an intruder poorly hidden behind a curtain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Or:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Panic is a misuse of oxygen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At Knole I bought <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781841657882\">Rooms of their own</a></em> by Nino Strachey, which is a large format pictorial book of the rooms of Edward Sackville-West, Vita Sackville-West, and (of course) Virginia Woolf. If you don’t find the Bloomsbury group and their era fascinating, you’re missing out.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Related, I also bought <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781472132482\">The Crichel Boys</a></em> by Simon Fenwick, which focuses in part on Eddy’s later life when he bought a house down in Dorset with some friends. That will be next on the list – I feel like I’ve read a lot of fiction lately and need to balance it out. Reading books about writers seems like a good half-way house.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I was trying to contain a lot of work-related stress: Sunday night, I slept until 3 am and woke up with my head spinning, and the same on Monday night.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately I know enough about how that pans out to immediately put up the emergency bat-signal at work and talk to my team about it, which of course helped, and then we worked out what it was I was fretting about and sorted that out. Cue solid seven hour nights from then on, and a much happier Ian. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have been through this kind of thing a couple of times before and it always happens when for one reason or another I lose focus. I do not thrive when I try and take on too much – I end up circling around a bunch of thing and trying to do them all at once, which of course means I don’t actually do any of them to be best of my ability. That creates a nasty little feedback loop, and what clears it is always sitting down, getting my focus back on one thing per day, and breaking that cycle. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One Saturday night we had a trip into town to go to the Free Range open mic night, where one of our friends was doing a performance involving sculpture and inviting the audience up to interact with them and, if they wanted, read from the texts on them. It was a lot of fun and involved three whole pints which is an event rare enough to be fun and get me quite drunk. The days when I could drink all night are long, long gone. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m trying to consolidate all the online storage I have into less places. My subscription to Office 365 is up soon and I’m almost certainly going to give it up: I have access to the Office suite through work if I need it, and I prefer using Nisus Writer as a word processor and Scrivener or Ulysses for writing more generally. Dropbox is also going, as I don’t need it either – I’ll probably consolidate all my cloud storage into iCloud. I’ve been testing Nextcloud and it’s good, but unless I’m migrating away from everything else it’s just another thing to keep track of. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>This week I have been reading…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A swift canter through Ken MacLeod’s <em>Beyond the reach of Earth</em>, which was OK. I often find the second volume of a trilogy is the low point, as you never find out whatever the “big reveal” is likely to be and quite often the series seems to be treading water. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also finished Neal Asher’s <em>Jack Four</em>, and am half way through it. It was a bit Asher-by-numbers, with that blend of hard SF and horror which makes him a fun read, but I saw the twist at the end coming when I had read about 50 pages which made it more than a bit unsatisfying. It would have been more fun had that twist been something entirely different. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Neal’s an interesting character. We used to chat a bit on social media (back in the days when social media was a bit move conversational and a bit less performative) and although our politics are worlds apart I always liked him. His beloved wife passed away a few years ago and it really seemed to hit him hard. I hope that he’s in a better place now.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I finished Claire Keegan’s <em>Foster</em> which was an absolute delight. It’s a long short story, not even long enough to call it a novella, but it’s just a beautiful piece of writing. Highly recommended. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All that has taken me to five books this month and twelve for the year so far. Next up is Julia Armfield’s <em>Our wives under the sea</em> which I’m looking forward to as I loved her short story collection <em>Salt Slow.</em> I have booked myself on to another Arvon writing course later in the year and Julia is one of the tutors, so it will be interesting to learn more about how she writes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>This week I have been writing…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I worked a bit on the <em>Shaye and La Muerte</em> stories, but I’m feeling a yen to go back to something which isn’t fantastical for a while.

And the readers aren’t much better (see every comment thread on <em>The Register</em> for more).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also wrote something about Substack Notes, published it on Substack, and then realised that I already loathed Substack enough to want to delete my account – which I promptly did. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>Reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I finally finished Becky Chambers’ <em>Record of a Spaceborn Few</em> after a month of putting it down and picking it back up again. It took quite a while for me to get into it: Chambers’ work is heavily character-driven, and this one weaves together the narratives of quite a few characters. But after about halfway, when there’s a single point of plot which changes the whole thrust of the book, I raced through it. And (not for the first time in her work) I got a little emotional. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love how she writes: I’m almost sad that there’s only <em>The Galaxy, and the Ground Within</em> and <em>To be taught, if fortunate</em> left to read. But I’m taking a break and diving into Ken MacLeod’s <em>Beyond the reach of Earth</em> instead, just for a bit of a change of pace. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also quickly finished <em>Make Something Wonderful</em>, the collection of speeches and quotes from Steve Jobs created by the Steve Jobs Archive (and available for download for free). I am very familiar with almost everything in it. Jobs, and Apple, were the subject of my work for many years, and the return of Jobs to Apple happened when I was actively reporting on the company. But seeing all this familiar material laid out as part of a historical narrative makes it clear how much Jobs developed throughout his life. Of course, he wasn’t a saint; this isn’t a biography. But it’s taking the best of a person and using it to inspire thinking in others, which is no bad thing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

It <a href=\"https://www.icfj.org/news/new-research-illuminates-escalating-online-violence-musks-twitter\">curtailed efforts to prevent attacks on women journalists</a>, leading to an upsurge in more attacks. It <a href=\"https://www.pride.com/technology/elon-musk-journalists\">reinstated the accounts of far right activists</a> who had been suspended because of threats to journalists. It has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/7/23674936/twitter-marking-substack-links-unsafe\">deliberately reduced the reach of posts mentioning Substack</a>, a platform which many journalists use to directly reach audiences. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And of course this is in addition to providing a safe harbour for bigots, racists, homophobes, transphobes, anti-semites, anti-vax myth peddlers, climate change deniers, and <a href=\"https://euromaidanpress.com/2023/04/08/twitter-removes-restrictions-on-russian-government-accounts-the-telegraph/\">mass murderers</a> who have been <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-vladimir-vladimirovich-putin-and\">charged with war crimes</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So why do journalists appear so reluctant to even reduce their time on Twitter, let alone abandon what’s obviously a dying platform which is slowly choking on the hate that Musk is encouraging? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a few factors at play. The first is that most journalists are incredibly conservative when it comes to new technology of any kind. Journalists were slow to understanding blogging and how it was going to change publishing. They were slow to social media: as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anildash/status/1642714308248256513?s=20\">Anil Dash points out</a>, “prestige media won’t go to the fediverse for another 2 years, same lag where they didn’t think Twitter existed until after Ashton Kutcher legitimized it.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second is that almost universally journalists overestimate the amount of engagement and traffic which accrue from Twitter versus any other kind of social media. When I worked in audience development, I would often ask journalists who weren’t familiar with traffic numbers where they thought social traffic came from. Universally, they would put Twitter at the top.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, referrals from Facebook dwarf Twitter, and they always have. <a href=\"https://www.echobox.com/resources/blog/social-media-is-driving-traffic-to-news-websites-and-one-source-dwarfs-all-others/\">Facebook accounts for 90% of social media traffic for publisher and news websites</a>, 10x that of Twitter:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1128,\"align\":\"center\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/e92db02b83.jpg\" alt=\"That red smudge?

Facebook.</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If what you care about is ordinary people reading your stories, you will get 10x the results from effort put into Facebook vs Twitter. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What you won’t get – and this is the important point – is 10x the attention from other journalists. Journalists love Twitter because it connects them to other journalists. It’s talking shop, and shop window for themselves and their work. Some journalists have made their careers through being noticed by other journalists on Twitter: there is an entire coterie of political journalists, for example, who have become “big beasts” because of the attention they get there, not from ordinary people, but from other journalists. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Journalism is an intensely social and sociable practice. It’s also often – particularly in newspapers - run on a “who you know” basis, which is one of the reasons that <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/education/how-many-journalists-went-public-school/\">over half the top 100 journalists in the UK went to public school</a>. Being able to parade your engagement skills on Twitter in front of your peers has helped people get jobs, and, at the very least, it can establish your name. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So no, I’m not surprised that journalists are clinging to Twitter like a life raft, despite the direct attacks from Musk, the bigotry, and the clear decline in the platform’s importance to ordinary people.

From the second-hand heaven that is <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ghostpapamargate/?hl=en\">Ghost Papa</a> in Margate came Mick Farren's <em>Give the anarchist a cigarette</em>, which details his days from early beatnik in Ladbroke Grove to drug-smashed former hippy turned punk in... Ladbroke Grove. And alongside Farren came DM Thomas' <em>The White Hotel</em>: Thomas, too, was tangential to the same scene in the '60s, with much of his early poetry published in <em>New Worlds</em> magazine alongside the likes of M John Harrison, JG Ballard and (of course) Michael Moorcock.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also purchased: Julia Armfield's <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781529017250\">Our wives under the sea</a></em>.

There was a bonus from work and it was <em>exactly</em> the amount that a new M2 MacBook Air cost, which I took as a sign from the fates that it was time to replace my 16in Intel-based MacBook Pro. I can also sell some machines which I have lying around and no longer really use to effectively cover the entire cost.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course I still have (and use) the ThinkPad running Linux but I can’t get out of the old technology journalist habit of having one machine for each of the main operating systems, because <em>you never know when someone might commission me to write something.</em> No one actually commissions me to write anything these days, mainly because I don’t actually have the time to write other than stuff for work, the odd blog post, and my creative writing. One day I will get everything down to one computer, but that day isn’t today.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Early impressions though are positive and it makes me realise quite how compromised the machines which Apple made during the 2010s were. Prior to 2015, I used a MacBook Air – first an 11in version, then a 13in one – and then in 2015 got the new 12in ultra-thin and light MacBook. That computer was Apple’s first to use the much-loathed butterfly keyboard, which was forgivable on a laptop which was designed to be incredibly thin. But using it on the rest of the range was one of Apple’s worst mistakes in its history, because it made their best-selling computers horrible to type on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The 12in MacBook got replaced by a 13in i5-based MacBook Air (horrible keyboard, underpowered) and then a 16in Intel MacBook Pro (expensive, improved but still crap keyboard, underpowered because Intel was at a low point). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The M2 Air replaces that MacBook Pro and it’s like night and day. Literally, because I bought the “Midnight” version which is a delicious shade of almost-black blue. It’s also far snappier than the MacBook Pro, completely silent and – IMPORTANT – has a keyboard which you can type on. I can’t say how much of an improvement this keyboard is, and when you spend much of your life typing that really does matter a lot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This MacBook Air is the first design that I’ve loved since the mid-00’s MacBooks, with their chunky polycarbonate (who didn’t love the black MacBook?). It’s almost as if Apple has remembered to make the Mac a combination of loveable <em>and</em> functional, after a fallow decade when it really lost its way. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile we went to a local village fate yesterday where Kim was the judge for the cake category:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":1120,\"align\":\"center\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/929fea40ff.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1120\"></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The fruit cakes were, apparently, all of high standard. While Kim was judging I spent some time working on some fiction I’ve been playing with for a while, re-plotting and outlining a story which hasn’t been quite hanging together. I’ve been using Aeon Timeline to do the outline, because it features some nice capabilities around navigating the complexities of multiple timelines while integrating with Scrivener. It’s a complex piece of software and I feel like I’m only just getting my head around it, despite using it for over a year. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>This week I have been writing…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wrote a short piece about <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2023/03/25/ai-like-jon-snow-knows-nothing/\">the limitations of current AI</a>, which takes me back about 25 years. Before I joined MacUser and became a journalist, I did a PhD in philosophy, looking at the implications of Kant’s philosophy of mind for artificial intelligence. At that time, cognitive science – a blend of computer science, philosophy and psychology – was the hot thing in AI, but in the past 10 years or so there seems to have been a return to the AI of the earlier years, which attempts to subdivide “intelligence” into a set of discreet functions capable of being developed in parallel. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My old thesis basically said the opposite: consciousness is a necessary part of what we mean when we talk about intelligence as it’s instantiated in humans, and consciousness is unitary (there are many functions in the brain, but only one “I”, no matter if you’re a human, a monkey, or a lizard). No amount of bolting a vision system on to an abstract reasoning processor on to a large language model will get you to unitary consciousness. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Was I right? I think the fact that despite the best efforts of very smart people, we are no closer to creating animal-like consciousness probably means I was. Large language models are impressive, but they “know” nothing – saying they do is a category mistake, as Gilbert Ryle would have put it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>This week I have been watching and reading…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We binge-watched <em>What we do in the shadows</em> this week and I haven’t watched anything which made me laugh out loud so much for a while. We’ve been wandering round the house randomly shouting “BAT!” in a Matt Berry voice, then collapsing into laughter. With <em>Ted Lasso</em> and <em>The Mandalorian</em> on at the same time, and <em>The Power</em> also now out, there’s plenty to watch. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two new books on the virtual book pile: Ken McLeod’s <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9780356514802\">Beyond the reach of Earth</a></em> and Katherine May’s <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9780571378333\">Enchantment</a></em>. I enjoyed McLeod’s book is the second in a series, the first of which I enjoyed quite a bit, and I greatly enjoyed May’s <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781846045998\">Wintering</a></em> too (pretty much a lockdown book) so I’m looking forward to both.

My view is the opposite: I don’t think that, as currently constituted, large language model-based AI Is capable of much improvement. Like almost every kind of AI research in the last 30 years, it’s a one-trick pony rather than a generalised system. And the story of AI research since its foundation is littered with one-trick ponies which can’t be grafted onto a more generalised intelligence. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Animal-style intelligence is a set of emergent properties that evolved in parallel, not separately. Our ability to do vision and other sensations, abstract reasoning, and communications – which covers most of what we think of as intelligence – continually interacted with and reinforced each other over millions of years. We didn’t evolve any of those capabilities in isolation. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that’s why all machine learning efforts that solve one thing at a time will fail to produce truly intelligent systems. You can’t just “solve the vision problem” then graft on a large language model, then crowbar in an abstract game-playing system and have something intelligent. It’s like putting together a jigsaw by ignoring the shapes and just cutting off bits of the pieces till they “fit” – you lose the complete picture. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Both my siblings are older than me -- my sister is just inching up to 70, while my brother is a couple of years younger. One of the joys of that shrinking of the perception of years has been that the mental distance that an 11-13 year age gap created has vanished.

You decide to delay getting something done to your house, and the next time you think about it, a year has passed, and nothing has happened. You think you need to do some preventative maintenance on your roof, and then the next time you consider it, your joists are failing. This is why old people's lives slide into ruin: the \"someday\" that you say you will get around to doing something passes in the blink of an eye.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are a lot of \"somedays\" surrounding our house at the moment.

It's another thing being bombarded with toxic masculinity, which defines you as <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/23640192/sebastian-ghiorghiu-youtube-hustle-gurus-passive-income-dropshipping\">a failure unless you have a lambo</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The right talks about \"groomers\", but if preying upon the anxieties of young people to indoctrinate them into a system where they can only fail isn't a form of grooming, then I don't know what is.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, all this is an attempt to tap into the alienation that capitalism causes, persuading its victims that it's all their fault and that if they just did the right things, they too could be rich, successful and forever young.

It was magnificent: alternately funny and heartbreaking and an absolute wake-up call that trans people need our support because what they are going through is terrifying. If you get a chance, see it – or if you don’t, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Burgerz-Oberon-Modern-Travis-Alabanza/dp/178682647X\">get the book</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are many things about living in London which I don’t miss.

Where I live now is also on the edge of a city, although Canterbury is a very different one from Derby.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I definitely miss about London, though, is the culture. The ability to get on a tube and 30 minutes later be in the National Gallery, or the V&amp;A, or on the Southbank was brilliant. Despite its rich history Canterbury is a bit of a cultural wasteland: if you want art or interesting events, you have to head to the coast. Ramsgate, Folkestone, and of course, Margate are all more culturally rich than Canterbury, which is in thrall to its past. Never live in a place where half the city centre is a world heritage site. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I finally caved in and bought <em>Elden Ring</em>, after about a billion people recommended it. I’m only a few hours in – five hours play time, apparently – and I’m not that impressed. I think my issue is that the world is just too open: and so far, at least, there isn’t much in the way of a world to interact with. All I’ve done is kill things and die, with a smearing of a story on top. Maybe I need to explore more, but so far it feels dull and very focused on grinding. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Getting it running meant getting my gaming laptop updated and working well again. It’s been about six months since I started it up, as I dropped out of playing Elder Scrolls Online after playing it consistently. I think I will get back into it once I’ve been through some of Elden Ring (enough to confirm that I don’t like it). MMORPGs have been a consistent part of my life for over 20 years after I first started playing Ultima Online. From UO, I went to Dark Age of Camelot, World of Warcraft, and then ESO. I even have a statue of an orc riding a warg, which was sent out by WoW to everyone who had played for ten years from the start (I was actually in before then, in beta). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The main thing that I’m working on currently is an international project, which means I spend a lot of time with colleagues in Poland and Germany on Microsoft Teams calls. It was good to meet some of them face-to-face for the first time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was a flying visit both literally and figuratively, as I flew out from Stansted on Tuesday morning for meetings in the afternoon, stayed over for more meetings the following morning, then back to the UK in the evening.

Back in the late 90s/early 2000s I did a lot of it, mostly transatlantic, and it cured me of any notion of flying as romantic or exciting. I enjoy new places, but the logistics of flying in the post-9/11 era are just painful. Both Stansted and Modlin are small airports, which are usually more interesting and fast to fly from than big ones like Heathrow, but even so it’s just a dull and stressful way to travel. Next time I could go by train – it takes a day, but that’s all time when you can work (and I quite fancy the idea of going from London to Amsterdam to Berlin to Warsaw as it sounds quite intriguing and romantic).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though the trip only took a couple of days, it dominated the week. I had to stay over at Stansted on Monday night, as getting there for an 8am flight (arriving two hours earlier) would have been brutally hard. Add in packing time, returning time, unpacking and all the other things which surround the act of travel, and you have much of the week disappearing into nothing, or, as Jerry Pournelle used to say, “the time was eaten by locusts”. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>What I've been writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And suddenly this week I realised that I had the first draft of a chapter, which was a lot more than I thought I had achieved. What I actually need to do with that story is sit down and do a proper plot for it. One of the things that I have noticed about writing is I tend to dive in and write, then lose the will to live as I try and “pants it”. I have a rough outline, but it’s not enough: I need to think more carefully about what each scene is there to do, and how it advances the story. Of course, I can change it as I go along – I’m not going to turn down a great scene which doesn’t relate to the plot at the point of writing – but at least if I have a more detailed outline I can see the way forward when my writing gets into the weeds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s part of the fun of what I’m doing: I’m learning how to write in a way which is unfamiliar and which challenges me.

I’ve been reading <em>Constance, </em>by Matthew Fitzsimmons, which is a sort of techno-thriller which I think I picked up as a freebie on Amazon Prime. It’s OK, but not my usual genre, and I can almost see the plot laid out before me just from having read the first chapter. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing I had noticed about myself is my tendency to drift into comfort reading, going through books that I have read before and which I find both easy and relaxing. I did some of that earlier this year when I raced through Robert Heinlein’s <em>Starship Troopers,</em> and I am doing a bit of it again at the moment. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This time round it’s a drift through Arthur C Clarke’s <em>Tales from The White Hart</em>. It’s a collection of short stories written in the “club tales” style, which was popular in the early part of the 20th century. This takes the form of several short stories which are all bookended as if they were being told in a pub or club, and it’s a nice conceit. It would be interesting to do something reinventing that style for the age of the internet. What’s the equivalent of the club tale for the internet age?

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Looking through some old documents, I rediscovered <a href=\"https://craphound.com/lifehacks2.txt\">Cory's notes on a talk that Danny gave</a> at Notcon in 2004 on todo.txt (I might even have been there, who knows?) Todo.txt was (and still is) a text-based format for task management designed to be incredibly simple to use and -- most importantly -- to be completely portable. The bare bones details of it are, of course, on Github, and there are apps around that support it for every platform you can think of.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have grown to love systems like this for a bunch of reasons. First, tools which start off with the simplest and most human-readable file formats are likely to have longevity over ones which hide their content inside a database. The popularity of formats like Markdown (which I am of course, writing this in) demonstrates that. Todo.txt is 20 years old and still bubbling under. Can you still access your to-do list from 20 years ago?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>(Although, of course, the inevitable rejoinder to that is, \"and why would I want to?\")</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, they are canonical examples of creating tools that are capable of being used in incredibly simple ways to start with. You can start using it with just a text file, any editor you like, and a list of tasks with no fancy bullets. You don't even have to add prioritisation if you don't want to, although that's a good place to start! You can use GTD-style projects and contexts... or not. And of course, if you want to add your own metadata, you can.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's the opposite of tools like Things, Todoist, Microsoft To do or the million and one other apps which promise to sort out your productivity through the power of technology. Nothing can do that -- the only thing that can is you writing things down, reflecting on them, and hopefully somewhere in the middle of those two activities doing whatever you need to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In other digital archaeology, I also found that Maelstrom 3.0 is available for Mac, Windows and Linux. Damn, where did that week go?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the start of the week, I was also doing quite a bit of thinking about AI tools like the new Bing Chat (which Microsoft is now trying to reign back into being just a conversations search tool) and how they will impact on publishing. Short version: they will encourage a race to the bottom in quality, but that will mean a premium gets put on what you might call \"handmade content\". This has been the story of every technology so I don't think writing will prove to be anything different. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You never know. Maybe the inevitable profits from this will go to <a href=\"https://www.jrf.org.uk/report/universal-basic-income-good-idea\">universal basic income</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-64669987\">a four day work week</a> rather than lining the pockets of capitalists. Ha ha who am I kidding?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stuff I've written</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have basically written a big update to my article on how to get Scrivener working on Linux (I've found a reasonably reliable way of making it work on Fedora too) but need to do an edit before I post it. It's basically a ground-up write and much improved.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stuff I've been reading and watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I had thought that Twitter's decision to limit SMS-based 2FA was stupid because they retained a notably insecure authentication method for paying customers, but <a href=\"https://rmondello.com/2023/02/18/twitter-sms-2fa/\">Ricky Mondello's article</a> on it changed my mind: it's stupid because they aren't retaining it for everyone. Ricky works for Apple on stuff like the iOS/macOS password management features, so they know what they're talking about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week I made a quick canter through Robert Heinlein's <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781473616110\">Starship Troopers</a>. I had forgotten quite how little the book is satire and quite how much it's a distillation of Heinlein's political ideas written into what we would now call a \"young adult\" novel. I loved that book as a kid for all the reasons that kids love good YA fiction: it doesn't patronise, and it makes you feel like you're reading something just a little more grown-up than you should.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fortunately, I also read M John Harrison's <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781857989977\">The Centauri Device</a> around the same time, which is very much not a YA book but had an equal and opposite effect on my young politics. I must be due a read of that again soon.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Spoilers: most of them were, in fact, deceased.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I did a bit of technology faffing too. I wanted to update my guide to <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2022/10/26/how-to-run-scrivener-on-linux/\">getting Scrivener up and running on Linux</a> to include Fedora, which didn't work the last time I tried it. I had some ideas on how to get it running but didn't have anything with Fedora on it. So I backed up my ThinkPad, wiped everything and did a Fedora install. Yes, I could have used a virtual machine. No, I didn't want to do that because I love tinkering.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After a few days of fighting with Wine, I gave up. I got a lot closer to making it work -- this time around I could get Scrivener installed and running, but couldn't register it. I know what the problem is, and it's a weird one which can be fixed by installing the Microsoft Speech API, but unfortunately, I just couldn't get that to work. Precisely the same process and packages work fine on Ubuntu-based systems, so it's something odd and unique about Fedora. Eventually, I gave up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So as well as a trip to Whitstable for a ridiculous sandwich at Grain and Hearth, yesterday involved rebuilding the ThinkPad using Pop!OS, and restoring from backup. I pondered going to Ubuntu 22.10 instead but decided I would miss the tiled windowing system of Pop. It's a little overdue an update, as System76 are <a href=\"https://blog.system76.com/post/more-on-cosmic-de-to-kick-off-2023\">rewriting the entire user interface in Rust</a>, but it still feels a lot more friendly than Ubuntu. Opinionated, but in a good way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When exactly did I become a Linux user? Although I'm tempted to <a href=\"https://usesthis.com/interviews/cory.doctorow/\">blame Cory for this</a>, the serious answer is \"since Microsoft started turning Windows into the kind of system which reports back far too much user data and <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/is-windows-11-spying-on-you-new-report-details-eye-opening-levels-of-telemetry\">effectively spies on you</a>.\" I don't mind optional telemetry going back to developers to improve software, and when it's opt-in I generally do exactly that. But Windows seems to be heading on a track to being a giant data capture system to power Microsoft's advertising growth, which makes me really uncomfortable. I should probably write something longer about this at some point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course I'm still knee-deep in Macs and other Apple devices. But I really enjoy using the ThinkPad with PopOS. It takes more time to set up and tune to precisely what your needs are, but once you've done that it's simple, reliable and doesn't tell a vast company exactly what you're doing all the time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I've been writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having invested that time in failing to make Scrivener work on Fedora I have completely rewritten my blog post, and it's almost ready to be published. It's been a sluggish week on the fiction side though. I revisited an idea I had a while ago for a series of interconnected stories about a girl in a post-apocalyptic world who makes friends with Death (they bond over a scrawny chicken). It's fun just writing a set of little stories in the same world without having an overarching structured narrative. While the story takes them about four billion years into the future, everything is just character development. And it has a nice ending, deep at the end of time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What I've been reading and watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having finished John Sculley's Odyssey: Pepsi to Apple, I've picked up Gareth Powell's About writing again. It's an interesting book, but it is a bit like a compilation of blog posts. Nothing wrong with that, but it means it's not really all that structured. If you want a book about the work of writing, Antony Johnston's The Organised Writer is better, and if you want a book about the craft of writing, there are a lot of other options. It's not bad, but if you know much about writing, I think you will breeze through it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week we watched -- finally -- the first episode of <em>Happy Valley</em>, and that was enough for me. I didn't like it at all. Too graphic in a way which felt like it was going to appeal to voyeuristic sadists who enjoy making women suffer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, there was the first episode of series three of Picard, which picked up where the last series left off by being nowhere near as good as the first one. And has everyone forgotten that Picard is an android now? That feels like it might be important to how other people treat him, but it's ignored.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The one I have been working in for the past couple of years was really only intended to be the kind of thing you sit in for an hour at a time, reading and writing the odd letter. It looks lovely but when your life is basically one long Teams call it’s not that comfortable. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I now have a decent but somewhat ugly chair which lets me sit more comfortably, and which I can lean back in (maybe for a small snooze?). On Tuesday a new filing cabinet will arrive which will let me get rid of the ridiculous amount of paper that I’ve got lurking around. And next weekend I am going to spend some time clearing out, vacuuming and generally turning my office space from a bit of a tip to something that’s much more enjoyable to sit in a work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have even got myself a new wastepaper bin. Never let it be said that I don’t live a rock and roll life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m still futzing around trying to decide what the optimum keyboard is though. There are two options: the Das Keyboard (built like a tank, sounds like something from the 1970s, wired) and the Keychron K2 (smaller, neater, Bluetooth or wired, probably couldn’t be used to bludgeon a burger to death as you could with the Das Keyboard). Both of them use the same kind of switches, although the feel is a bit different thanks to the difference in housing and size. The K2 has some clear advantages: I prefer the feel of it a little, it can be set up at several different angles and it’s a little less like listening to an exchange of machine gun fire. Both are really good keyboards. The K2 is also backlit which can be useful in some circumstances. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Part of rearranging my desk space has involved moving the Mac mini from its normal place beside the display to underneath a screen riser. The riser is just big enough to also house an Apple external DVD drive (I am gradually ripping a load of music which is still on CDs) and the CalDigit Thunderbolt dock, which was one of the best purchases I made. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Mac mini is one of the loveliest Macs I have owned. It’s the base level M1 version, with just 8Gb of memory and a paltry 256Gb of storage, but it’s perfect for the kinds of things I do with it. Most of my files are synced to the cloud anyway, so my actual storage needs are a lot lower than they would be with some other machines. It’s absolutely silent and the M1 is surprisingly powerful not just at the day-to-day tasks of work but also occasional video and audio editing. Sure, if you are spending your entire life editing videos you probably want more memory, but for me? Nope. 8Gb turns out to be just right. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Did I mention it’s silent?

The CGI was second-rate, despite apparently being quite expensive, probably because every external shot from the rig and of the rig was CGI. It ends on a cliffhanger that’s obviously a desperate attempt to drum up enough interest to make a second series viable, but without ever really making the characters believable enough to care about them. When a writer throws in the Hail Mary pass of making a character pregnant about two-thirds of the way through the series, you know it has reached the point where no one cares about these characters, and they are just throwing the kitchen sink at the page.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My bad reading habit of putting aside one book and starting another (often something I have read before) reappeared this week, when I temporarily dropped Becky Chambers’ <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781473621473\">A Closed and Common Orbit</a></em> in favour of picking up M John Harrison’s short story collection <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781912697281\">Settling the World</a>.</em> The good bit about short story collections is that I race through them quickly.

Although, to be fair to me, Harrison’s shorts aren’t always easy meat: a story about how embedding an axe into your face becomes fashionable is… well, weird.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest “watch” of the week is <em>Empire of Light,</em> Sam Mendes’ new film, which would be a shoo-in for the Best Picture Oscar in another year. However, because St Steven of Spielberg has released a film which is not only semi-biographical but a love letter to making movies, he will win, and everything else will get consolation prizes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this case, those consolation prizes should include a bunch of technical Oscars – the lighting is amazing – as well as Olivia Coleman getting a second one, Micheal Ward getting at least a nomination for best actor, and you can take your pick of Toby Jones and Colin Firth for best supporting actor. Everyone in the supporting cast is excellent. A little shout out to Tom Brooke, who you might recognise from his role in <em>Preacher</em> and who turns in a lovely little performance full of kindness and light. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is definitely cinema season, with both <em>Tár</em> and <em>Enys Men</em> coming up soon, plus <em>More than Ever. </em>Lots to see.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Good to see everyone I work with, though. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news was that my MacBook Pro was brought back from the dead by our local independent Apple dealer. It had been dead for several months after a failed update to Ventura (thanks largely to our poxy broadband), which led to a strange “cryptographic error” happening every time it tried to update anything. I assume this was down to the disk encryption going wonky, but I decided to nuke the whole thing from orbit (it’s the only way to be sure) and reinstall Monterey, then make a fresh attempt to update.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, that update failed too. So I tried wiping the whole disk and promptly lost the ability to see it, even via Target Disk Mode. Once I had tried using Apple Configurator to fix it — the last option available — and that had failed, it was time to bring in the experts. And a day later, I had a working, upgraded, very blank MacBook Pro.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s been good to get back to using a Mac laptop after quite a while when I didn’t really have one (my old MacBook Air is also in need of a wipe and install), using Mac-native tools like Ulysses rather than cross-platform ones. And the Pro has a 16in screen, which feels much less cramped than the 14in one on my ThinkPad. Even though it’s the last generation of Intel Macs, it’s still an excellent machine with a few years of life left in it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has been a bit of a frustrating writing week. I reached an impasse with the <em>Alice and God</em> story, which I started before Christmas because I had done a rough outline of the plot but reached the point where I needed to flesh it out a bit more - and I was trying to write my way through it instead. That doesn't really work for me: I either need to know nothing about what's going on (in which case I discover it through writing) or have a reasonably solid idea of what a scene is supposed to do in the plot (in which case I can give it some direction). So back to the plotting board!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And because I love tinkering around with tools, I will start using Ulysses again rather than Scrivener. Don’t get me wrong — Scrivener is an excellent application for putting together anything long-form — but I think it’s a bit fussy, and I like the idea of having all my writing in one place. At the moment, it’s split between Ulysses and Obsidian (blog posts and short-form) and Scrivener (long-form), and it’s not quite gelling for me. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reading and watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, a quiet week for reading: I restocked the unread books stack with a few items. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the first day of a year falls on a Sunday, I suspect it's a good idea to look back on the previous year. A yearnote, if you will.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I could look back at the year's posts and pick out highlights, but as it's about a year, I think it's better to look at the key themes that defined 2022. Obviously, these are things I can talk about -- so there's nothing about work here -- and I've chosen to look at the positives rather than the negatives, which I will save for my journal.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With that context, the year has three themes: rediscovering writing, focusing more on my health, and reading. A lot of reading.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rediscovering writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been a journalist for (as of two days from now) 28 years. That seems fantastical to me as I still think of myself as the new kid on the block. This year forced me to accept that wasn't true, and I realised that what I do now in journalism is managing, mentoring and advising. I don't really write much.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And one thing that's been consistent throughout my career and life is that I love writing. I got a typewriter as a teenager because I liked writing stories which turned into Dungeons and Dragons campaigns, and my handwriting was… not great (it still isn't). I learned to touch type at 16 at further education college because you had to do a Wednesday afternoon activity, and sport bored me. After that, I was a student and wrote, and then I was a journalist and wrote. So writing has always been there.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I needed an outlet for my writing. And importantly, I didn't want to just do more blogging about technology. One thing I hadn't done was a lot of creative writing because I've always believed I don't have the imagination to make stories up. So I decided I wanted to give it a go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, I took a small weekly course based in a pub with a lovely writing tutor and a friendly group of people. I can't think of a better introduction to creative writing than doing it in a summer pub's garden, and we have continued meeting since.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That led to doing a five-day fiction introduction down at Arvon in Totleigh Barton. Tutored by the wonderful pairing of Charlene Teo and Michael Donkor, it was enormous fun and super-helpful in terms of my writing. But, most importantly, I think I found my voice: I had been writing how I felt I should note, and now I write how I want to write. And again, our group has stayed in touch. I don't think I had realised quite how social writing can be.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the lovely moments was talking through a story idea I had been working on with Michael, which I had always envisaged as a short story. I had struggled a lot with it because I had to write short -- and Michael said, \"this isn't a short story. It sounds like a novel to me\". I had always veered away from writing a novel, and it started me thinking about why. I realised two things: first, that I lacked the confidence to complete it, and second, that I have so many friends who have written novels that I think I've been intimidated by the idea. Michael helped me get over that, and if I ever finish a book, it will be down to the help and encouragement they gave me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Focusing on my health</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The big revelation about my health this year was that post-COVID, I need to take regular care of myself. Getting COVID the first time coincided with increased blood pressure and, because of less activity, putting on weight. Going from 10,000 plus steps per day when I was in the office to less than 5,000 working from home was always going to have an impact.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this year, I started making some positive steps. For the first time in my life, I've been a regular attendee at our local GP for everything from booster vaccinations to blood tests to check that I'm not developing anything more serious. I've started taking medication to reduce my blood pressure (now at a decent level), and I've been looking after my vision with more regular check-ups at the opticians.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In 2023 this will continue as I develop more healthy eating and exercise habits, where simple changes will make a lot more difference.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Doing more reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I was pretty surprised to find that I read 27 books in 2022. That's the most I had read since the internet happened when all my reading shifted to computers. And it's also been a wide range of books, not just trash science fiction (there's been some <strong>good</strong> science fiction).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm really pleased with this. Reading and writing go hand in hand. The biggest thing you can do to improve your writing is to read more. So it's probably not surprising that rediscovering my love of writing has also prompted much reading.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What's also helped is using a new Kindle, the Scribe. I have always wanted a bigger Kindle. While the Paperwhite I have is excellent, it's always felt just a little too small. And being able to write on the Scribe with little notes is also a fun way to add commentary, even if the comments don't show up in my Readwise notes. It's always interesting to me how a shift in a device can also shift your interest in a process.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

We’re staying in lovely Ambleside, at a friend’s place (on our own). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course I love it and have a bunch of memories of the Lake District. It was a place where we went on family holidays a lot when I was a kid: here, along with Devon, Cornwall and the Cotswolds.

One of the things I’ve been working on is using humour to counterpoint seriousness and threat, and there’s a lot of that here. It has to be a serious story, with danger for the characters (and maybe, just maybe, one of them doesn’t make it), but the humour which is intrinsic to my writing style is there. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the resolutions for next year is to establish more of a rhythm to my writing.

One of my goals for 2022 was to go on a creative writing residential trip and I’m quite surprised at myself for having actually arranged it. Like most people my years tend to start with a bunch of promises and commitments which I only realise I haven’t done in December. This year appears to be different, but now that leaves me with the dreadful job of following on in 2023 with something else. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The last couple of days have been marred by me getting a particularly nasty cold, which kept me off work on Thursday and consigned me instead to either bed or the sofa underneath a blanket, gently whimpering. There’s definitely been a theme this year of getting minor colds whenever I spent any time out – and the start of this week involved a day-long workshop with work, plus of course Stereolab was last weekend. This the post-lockdown phase of an overall lack of immunity, quickly bred in by not being constantly around people. Or it could just be that there’s a lot of bugs going round. Maybe the experts know. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things I’ve been writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Quite often the answer to “what shall I write” is “start writing something about the last thing you read/watched/ate/saw”. That, though, can be a bit tricky — particularly if “the last thing you saw” is the movie version of <em>On The Buses,</em> one of the most low-rent but incredibly popular sitcoms of the 1970s. It was on ITV3. Don’t judge me. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But there is always an interesting tangent, if you spend a little time looking. In this case it was the story of Bob Grant, one of the main actors in the series. Despite having a really good track record in serious theatre – he was directed by Joan Littlewood in a few things, and Joan didn’t suffer bad acting gladly – Grant become horribly stuck in typecasting hell, and apart from a few one-offs and panto barely worked again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>He ended up making three suicide attempts over the years as the debts and hopelessness mounted with the third one being successful. It’s an incredibly sad story.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just after reading this I watched a 1987 <em>Arena</em> “day in the life” <a href=\"https://youtu.be/jgsuMqB_w_8\">piece about Jeffrey Bernard</a>, the legendary boozer and occasional journalist who bestrode Soho in what might have been its more creative period. Bernard too had something of a sad end. Thanks to the drinking, he descended through diabetes to having a leg removed, which made him virtually housebound in a small shabby Soho flat. Unable to do his habitual routes from Coach and Horses to bookies to Colony Club, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/efJ02m4wOkY\">he withered away</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I started writing something which I wanted to get into Bernard’s voice and after a few paragraphs it morphed into the story of an actor, like Grant, who struggled to get parts after national success. Three thousand words later, I have the kernel of a decent story, called “Bill and Trudy”, about an encounter between our Bob/Jeffrey amalgam (called Bill) and a homeless girl called Trudy during the height of the first wave of poverty caused by Thatcher in the late 1980s. I want it to be fun and upbeat and not too serious, but the end (which I’ve written already) is potentially a bit downbeat. It will be fun to see where it goes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things I’ve been reading and watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having cantered through Harry Turtledove’s <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781250829726\">Three miles down</a></em> I’ve continued in the SF vein by diving into Ken MacLeod’s <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9780356514796\">Beyond the Hallowed Sky</a></em>.

No, Tim, you cannot sustain a 30% cut of app revenue for the rest of the time.

Those days are over, and if you want to preserve the things which are good for customers about the App Store and your products, you need to accept that sooner rather than clinging on till a regulator changes things for you.

It took me almost completely out of action on Monday and Tuesday, as I just couldn’t sit at a computer and work – sitting up for too long was just painful. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think that a lot of it is to do with posture, not so much when I’m sitting and typing but when I’m in the endless parade of online meetings on Teams which forms quite a chunk of my work. When I’m in meetings I tend to slump a bit to my left, usually with my hand supporting my chin, which probably isn’t the best position to be sat for a long while.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s exacerbated by my chair, which is lovely to look at but not ideal for spending a great deal of time sitting in and typing. The height of it isn’t adjustable, and it’s a little low with a back support which is OK at the bottom but not <em>quite</em> at the right sort of angle for my daily use. To compensate, I’ve raised the height of my monitor so that it’s higher, which forces me to sit more upright when I’m using it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, this was also the week when the long-awaited Muskapocalypse basically happened on Twitter, which led to some reflection on the state and development of social media. I should, of course, write something up properly about this, but it’s made me understand that the difference between social media now and in 2006 is that the news we think requires immediate delivery to our followers is no longer personal, it’s political. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When Twitter started, it was one of a slew of services which aimed to decouple the “Status” field from instant messaging apps like AIM to a third party which could then provide a brief message about what you were doing to all your friends. My first tweet on December 3rd 2006 was “going for a dump”, and in a scatological way that summed up what Twitter was there for. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It became that, but on a much larger scale: a method of delivering “vital” information in a timely fashion to large groups of people. News breaks on Twitter now, even before it hits the (already fast) 24-hour news services. I doubt that’s a good thing, for reasons which would take a whole post to define.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Weeks which start with being off or sick often don’t turn into particularly productive times, but this one was a little different. We’re at the end point of a phase in the project I’ve been focused on at work, and the beginning of planning for the next phase. That means there’s some breathing room, although there’s still a lot of wrapping up to do (and there will be until the end of the year). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We also went to see <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever </em>on Friday (more on that below) and I booked my train ticket for the <a href=\"https://www.arvon.org/writing-courses/courses-retreats/residential-writing-week-starting-to-write-fiction/\">weeklong writing retreat</a> that I’m going on in December. I’m really looking forward to this, not only because it’s a week of writing, but also because it’s a week with no internet. Yes, that’s right: there’s no Wi-Fi (thanks to the building being ridiculously old and so hard to get connected) and virtually no mobile signal (5G? Forget it). I can’t wait. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Things I’ve been reading and watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever </em>was good. It wasn’t as good as the first film, but given the awful death of Chadwick Boseman, how could it be? The way it handled his passing and made it a part of the movie was brilliant: sensitive, emotional, everything you could have asked. I think I counted four or five times that had me sobbing, from the opening Marvel logo (which forsook the usual montage of many heroes to be all Chadwick) through to the credits which start with “For our friend, Chadwick Boseman”. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have no idea why his death has affected me so much – I can’t remember an actor’s death making me feel like this – but I think it is something to do with the impact of the first film and the realisation of how a black movie made me feel. Or maybe how having a movie which attracts a young black audience makes me feel: as with the first film, the majority of the audience at our showing was young and black and very much <strong>not</strong> the kind of audience you see at most Marvel films. It’s huge, and feels important.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, <em>Andor</em> continues to be the best Star Wars ever made. It’s lazy to call it “Star Wars for grown-ups” but it’s a proper adult thriller set in the universe, and has some absolutely terrific acting in it. Even if you don’t like Star Wars, I would recommend it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Things I’ve been writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not much, is the quick answer.

Text on screen becomes smaller, but the flip side is that you have more space to work with.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And Stage Manager <strong>really</strong> likes having the extra space. Windows overlap less, making it easier to flip between open applications on stage. You can have bigger windows while also seeing more of the shelf at the side. It just feels more natural and less cramped than the default zoom.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All the criticisms of Stage Manager generally are still true (and if you want a good collection of them, it’s worth looking at <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/stage-manager-ipados-16-1-review/\">Federico Viticci’s article</a>). But “More Space” has made a big difference to me, and now I find that I have Stage Manager on almost all the time. Except, of course, if I want to plug the iPad into an external monitor.

I'm more active on Mastodon, but that's partly because it feels like early Twitter -- so that might not be something I carry on with in the long term as the service evolves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, I've also broken my MacBook Pro. It failed while updating to Ventura with an odd error, so I decided the time was right to wipe it and reinstall the OS from scratch. This isn't the simple process it used to be, involving a disk image and some time. Apple's reinstall process now involves downloading code, and watching a progress bar with no information to it… and, in my case, failing at the end with a baroque error about cryptographic signatures on the disk. There shouldn't be any: I just wiped it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, when you wipe a Mac, you don't really wipe it: it's still connected to your iCloud account. This does not feel like progress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thankfully I know some of the most technical Mac people in the world, so I'll get it fixed, but it feels like it's more difficult to do this on a Mac now than it is on Linux, which doesn't seem the right way around.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I'm thinking of rebooting my newsletter, mainly to distribute this. If I do, I'll use Buttondown as a service, partly because it allows you not to track subscribers, something I'm keen to avoid. I don't want feedback on what you're reading or even to know how many people are subscribed, particularly. Data may be power, but creatively it can also be a prison.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Speaking of Linux, I wrote something outlining <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2022/10/26/how-to-run-scrivener-on-linux/\">how to get Scrivener working on Ubuntu</a>. Like most things about running Windows software on open-source operating systems, it's mostly about ensuring you have the correct libraries and stuff installed for Wine to work with. But there are also some ways to make Scrivener look less like a Windows app and more like one native to Linux, which are worth doing if, like me, you find such a distraction when you're writing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also wrote something on <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2022/10/27/the-ipads-confusing-line-up/\">John Gruber's defence of the iPad's current line up</a>. I can't understand anyone thinking this confusing mess is deliberate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Reading and watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The main thing I have been watching this week is rugby, with both League and Union having world cups.

Quin was active in the mid to late 1960s, a working class woman writer who pushed back against the prevailing gritty \"kitchen sink\" style in favour of something more interesting. Every now and then, there's a Quin revival, mostly amongst writers, but she's never had the recognition she deserves.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I disagree. There are specific <em>aspects</em> of the iPads in the lineup that are confusing, or at least disappointing. These aspects are mostly related to peripherals — which Pencils and which keyboard covers work with which iPads — and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/the_ipad_lineup_is_like_growing_out_its_bangs_or_something\">I wrote about these issues last week</a>. But in terms of the fundamental question facing would-be buyers — “Which iPad should I get?” — I don’t think this lineup is confusing. I’d argue, in fact, that it’s less confusing, because the lineup is more complete.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>John then spends 424 words explaining the differences in the lineup, not including the table he had already used to show the difference in pricing above this paragraph.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have to spend that long explaining the differences between the products on offer, there is definitely a problem with the coherence of the product line. This is doubly true hen your explanation has to go into the details of which device has a P3 colour gamut, which has an sRGB, which one has a \"media engine\", which one supports Bluetooth 5.2 vs 5.0 and more. And that's before you start explaining which peripherals are on offer and why exactly the first version of the Apple Pencil still exists <em>four years</em> after the second generation one was introduced.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you need reminding, the iPad is a device where you just shouldn't have to worry about that shit. It's a classic product where a Steve Jobs four quadrant approach works perfectly: consumer, pro; small screen/large screen. Of course, there will be variances in storage space within those quadrants, but the core of the product doesn't need to be more complex.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have no doubt Apple knows internally this is a mess of a lineup. However, there are many reasons a company ends up with a confusing product line, usually in a transition period for the device. Sometimes this is driven by parts supply: for example, if a key part in (say) the iPad Air is constrained and will be for some time, making a similar device without that part to siphon off customers is a smart move if you have the ability to do it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes it means an entire product remains in the lineup because you have a bunch of them that you need to sell off. And manufacturers can get blind-sided: it's easy to see how the new iPad could have been meant to be a replacement for the 9th generation version but ended up not being able to be manufactured at the same price.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Either way, the iPad line up <strong>is</strong> a mess. There might be good reasons why it is, but attempting to claim its not is a bit daft.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Yes, you can do it in Word or LibreOffice (or even, like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1258531094414032896?lang=en-GB\">Cory</a>, just a text editor), but the combination of structured rich text, note-taking, outlining and character notes that Scrivener has will make your life easier. And, of course, you can compile your work into just the right format at the end.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is no Linux version of Scrivener these days, probably because the number of people wanting to both run it and pay for it was insufficient to justify keeping it going. Them, as they say, are the breaks. There are several open-source alternatives, such as Manuskript and Bibisco, but when I've tried them I've always felt like they are a developer's idea of what writing is like, rather than a writer's. They feel like databases where you end up filling in fields, and that just doesn't work for me. That's not to say it won't work for you -- and you should try them and thank the developers for their work -- but it just doesn't work for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another option which can work on Linux but isn't open source is Obsidian. Using some judicious plugins, such as Longform, you can get some of the structured writing capability that Scrivener has, but to make it work, you need to spend a decent amount of time creating templates and tweaking, and all of that is time not spent writing. Oh, and get to know Pandoc. You will <strong>so</strong> need to know Pandoc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news is that you can get Scrivener working on Linux, and I will show you how to make it run and not look like a rat's ass. It takes a bit of work at the start but once done, it's done. Many pages around have part of the details of how to do this, but some don't quite work, and others have typos, so I thought I would pull everything together into a single article. Thank you, in particular, to <a href=\"https://writeside.com/update-scrivener-3-on-linux/\">Thomas Peltcher</a>, who started me off on the right track. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>A brief note about Fedora</strong>. These instructions should work with any Ubuntu-based distro. I've tested it on Ubuntu 22.04, 22.10, Mint 21.1, Pop!OS 22.04 and Zorin OS 16, and it all works. However, I have never been able to get this working on Fedora. Using the same steps, I can install Scrivener, but when I try to run it, it freezes at \"Loading fonts\". If anyone has a solution to this, feel free to either comment or email me, and I'll include it in this article.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Install Wine (7) and Winetricks</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first thing you will need to do is install Wine. If you're running Ubuntu 22.04, you will have an ancient version installed by default, and you probably want to update to Wine 7. However, Wine 7 can sometimes end up freezing, in the same way, trying to install on Fedora does so be prepared to roll-back if you find this. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Note: you don't <em>have</em> to install Wine 7 to make Scrivener work. It will work perfectly happily with the default available from Ubuntu 22.04, Ubuntu 22.10, or distros based on those versions. But it won't look as nice, and you may need to spend extra time in Wine tweaking it so it looks like a Windows 7 app and more like something close to native on Ubuntu. That's my setup at the top of the page. Looks pretty good, doesn't it?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are on Ubuntu 22.04, I have good news: all you need to do is go to the WineHQ page and follow the steps there using the Stable branch. however, if you are on 22.10 (as I am), you will need to choose the Development branch instead. The 22.10 version of Wine 7 hasn't been released, but it is in that branch. I am on the Development branch and have had no problems at all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, install Winetricks through the software store or via the terminal (sudo apt install winetricks will do it). Winetricks is a neat little app which makes it much easier to download and install optional parts of Windows that apps require, such as dotnet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configuring Wine</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, you need to set the architecture correctly. No, I don't really know what that means either, but basically, open up a terminal and type this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><code>sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386</code></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Followed by:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:code -->\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>env WINEARCH=win64</code></pre>\n<!-- /wp:code -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Important!</strong> That's a double-dash before \"add\", not an em-dash. You will often find instructions on the web have that wrong, not because the authors are idiots, but because, annoyingly, WordPress often \"helpfully\" converts double dashes to em-dashes. I've even seen some pages where users have commented correcting this from the text, and then WordPress has converted their double dashes into an em-dash. Thanks, WordPress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, you will want to install an appropriate version of dotnet and the core Windows fonts. You may already have the latter installed, but it's fine to do it again if you're unsure. In the terminal, type:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><code>env WINEPREFIX=$HOME/.wine winetricks --force dotnet45 corefonts</code></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Again, that's two dashes before \"force\". And again, WordPress often wants to convert it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally - and this should be final - run the Scrivener installer. Sometimes it has been known to crap out if you double-click on it, so the best way is via the terminal. Navigate to the directory where the installer is (mine was in ~/Downloads, as I had just downloaded it) and run this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><code>wine Scrivener-installer.exe</code></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That should be it, although some people have reported that it chokes when you try and enter your license code. If that's the case, the solution appears to be to install speechsdk, which you should be able to do via Winetricks. I haven't actually done it, but I didn't need to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Does Wine look really tiny to you? </strong>Wine doesn't play well with fractional scaling, so if you have that turned on you have a couple of choices. First, you could turn it off. But you probably don't want to, so what you need to do is go to the terminal and type \"winecfg\". Go the graphics tab and crank the DPI up to the point where the sample text looks nice and readable to you - on my 1900x1200 laptop, with fractional scaling at 125%, I make it 244dpi and it looks OK. But you may wish to go smaller or larger.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making it look like you actually want to use it</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So now you have a working version of Scrivener, yay! However, if it's anything like mine, it looks like a sack of crap with blurry fonts, tiny menu items, and so on. Good news: all of this is fixable. The bad news, it takes a bit of boring and repetitive work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, ensure that Wine is set to use the light appearance theme: it looks much better. This should be correct out of the box, but just in case it isn't, go to the terminal, enter winecfg, and go to the Desktop Integration tab. Set the theme to Light -- if you have Scrivener open, you'll need to quit and restart to make it take effect.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you open Scrivener, you might find things look a bit off. For example, when I installed everything from scratch every time I highlighted something in the Binder at the side it showed as black text with a black highlight -- not exactly readable. Another time it had buttons and menu items which didn't highlight at all, but worked perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is because Scrivener has its own theming system which doesn't always play nice out of the box with Wine. The good news is it's easily fixable. The best way is to reset the Wine theme to the default, which makes it look like ropey old Windows 98. But don't worry: the next step will change that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You could go through all the appearance options and set your own theme, but a quicker way is just to use a third party theme as your base and customise from there. There's a really good, simple white theme which I like <a href=\"https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/default-theme-white-theme/124131\">in the Scrivener forums</a>. This makes a great starting point for further customisation. Download it, change the extension from .zip to .scrtheme, and in Scrivener load it from File&gt; Options &gt; Manage button &gt; Import themes. Select the downloaded theme, load it and you're good to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, let's deal with those blurry fonts. This is down to your menus using fonts in Windows, but which don't match the ones in Ubuntu, so you need to change them to something which works on both. Open Scrivener, and in the File menu, choose options. In the Appearance tab/General Interface, change the GUI Font to something which more cleanly matches your Ubuntu install - I chose Ubuntu Light.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":912,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/f683a55736.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-912\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That settles the menus, but the Binder at the side may still look too small. In the same options, go to Binder, select the Fonts tab, and pick something nicer. Again, I've gone for Ubuntu light.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":913,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/bae93252ea.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-913\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can go through the rest of the interface, too, if you want, changing the fonts on Corkboard, Index Cards, Outliner, and so on to something which works more nicely for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once the interface looks decent, you will probably want to change the main editor, too -- unless you like really ropey Courier (hey, I'm not one to kink shame). This is done in the Editing tab. I've set mine to Optima because who doesn't love Optima? I've also bumped the paragraph spacing because I'm not a barbarian.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":915,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/06ddd58ed9.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-915\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Things which don't work</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You should now have a working installation of Scrivener, which doesn't look like trash. Almost everything will work, but there are a few things that don't, and you need to bear them in mind.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First of all, forget about importing a web page into notes directly. It will freeze Scrivener. Workaround this by saving any webpages you need as PDF or text and importing them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, some good news: Scratchpad works! Yay! However, it only works if you invoke it via the menu, <strong>not</strong> via a keyboard shortcut. And as with the Windows version, if you have saved web pages into the Binder on Mac, they're unreadable and might crash your app. If you're working cross-platform, make sure to convert them to text.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that's it! You should now have a working, good looking version of Scrivener. Now all you have to do is 50,000 words for NaNoWriMo and you'll be a writer. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I think some of it's proved wrong, but some are pretty prescient. In particular, I think the idea that the iPad's user interaction model was all about consumption was correct (although I didn't agree with this at the time). Enterprising users and developers have pushed the platform to be focused on creation too: <a href=\"https://mattgemmell.com/publishing-paperback-novels-with-an-ipad/\">Matt Gemmell writes and publishes novels on his</a>. But it's pushing and hacking and so on. Apple has finally acknowledged that the hardware is capable of much more than that, but it is now struggling to retrofit a more powerful and creator-focused user interface on it -- and I think iPadOS 16 is the point when the bough breaks. Apple's best option would be to make the iPad more open, of course (at least as open as the Mac) but I get the feeling there is still something of a religious war internally about doing that.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thurrott.com/hardware/274857/lenovo-thinkpad-x13s-review\">Paul Thurrott has reviewed the ThinkPad X13s</a>, the first ThinkPad running on an ARM processor.

The debate will rapidly descend into something approaching a brawl. The ability of keyboard nerds to come into conflict over the best key caps, switches, wired or Bluetooth, and in fact <strong>every</strong> aspect of what keyboards can and should be like is unparalleled in the computing world. If you think Windows and Mac fans can get feisty, just wait until you see the adherents of Cherry MX Brown vs Cherry MX Blues come to blows. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>From where I’m sat at my desk, I can see six different keyboards. I’ve tried everything, from ergonomic split keyboards from Microsoft to Apple’s Magic Keyboard and beyond. Mechanical, shallow-travel, you name it: I’ve tried all of them. And the one that I come back to all the time is the Das Keyboard Professional 4, which I’m typing this on at the moment. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I always imagined that the Das Keyboard was German. Das Keyboard sounds like the kind of declarative description that German companies love. But in fact, it’s all down to a small company in Austin, Texas, which has now been honing their skills in keys for seventeen years. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The best way to describe the build quality of the Das Keyboard Model 4 is that you could probably beat to death a reasonably stacked bodybuilder with it. It’s <strong>heavy</strong>, in a way that you will likely not be used to if you have only used laptop or even desktop standard keyboards. What the Das Keyboard has in common with Apple’s perfectly acceptable Magic Keyboard is they are both made from aluminium, and both have keys you press to make letters appear on-screen. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the similarities end there. Where the Magic Keyboard feels lightweight, utilising the inherent lightness of aluminium to make something that feels and looks like cultured engineering, the Das Keyboard is heavy enough to cause serious damage if you were to apply it with force to someone’s head. Any burglar attempting to rob the house of a writer in mid-flow on a Das Keyboard will be taking their lives into their hands. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The layout is similar to something like the classic IBM Model M, with the addition of media controls on the right, including a very satisfyingly tactile volume knob. There’s also a handy mute switch and a sleep button which, as the name suggests, brings up the sleep/shutdown dialogue box. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s no fancy backlighting – another thing it has in common with the Apple – because this isn’t a keyboard designed for gaming on. Of course, you can game on it if you like, and depending on the key switches you choose (more on that later) you will have a good gaming experience. But this is a keyboard designed to make typists, and particularly writers, feel at home. If you’re the kind of person who wears out the WASD key caps first, this probably isn’t the keyboard for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And there’s no Bluetooth: this is a USB wired keyboard complete with two additional USB 3 ports to act as a hub, which is handy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I selected Cherry MX Brown switches, which I find are perfect for the way that I type. They are soft, with the key click about halfway through the action, which means they don’t have quite the same SMASH click sound which you get with gaming keyboards or with Cherry MX Blue switches. If you’re not used to typing on a mechanical keyboard they can be tiring at first: your hands and wrists are used to depressing a key for just a couple of millimetres, whereas with these keys, you are going to apply anything from 2-5 mm of force. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This shouldn’t be a problem for me: I learned to touch-type on a manual typewriter. However, if you’re more often using a laptop, particularly one with limited travel, it can be hard to get used to. My advice is to do as much typing as you can on a mechanical keyboard, saving your work on a laptop as little as possible. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The keys are rated for at least 50 million depressions each, which means you will get a lot of typing out of this keyboard before you’re likely to get much wear. There’s also a special UV-resistant coating on the key caps to avoid fading from sunlight. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re the kind of person whose longest writing work is a bunch of emails, this is not the keyboard for you (unless they are <em>really</em> long emails). However, if you write professionally and spend your life hammering away, then the £159 or so it will cost you will be money well spent. This is a professional tool for professional writers, and it’s worth every penny.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I wouldn’t read too much into that. These are incremental updates, particularly to the iPad Pro. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s a new Folio Keyboard for the iPad, which looks good but which costs a really rather remarkable $249. On a device which costs $449 that really is quite a lot of money. And it weirdly supports the first generation Pencil rather than the newer (and much nicer) one. Although the iPad has a USB-C port, it doesn’t have the magnetic charging capability of the iPad Air and Pro – hence the old Pencil support. Of course that USB-C port means you need a <strong>dongle</strong> to charge your Pencil. Elegant design? Not really.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The iPad Pros (iPads Pro?) gain the M2 processor and WiFi 6E, which delivers some speed gains (15% faster processing, 35% faster graphics, 40% faster neural engine, 50% more memory bandwidth). It supports capturing and editing ProRes, which is a big plus for the people out there using iPad Pros as cameras (yes, they do exist). There’s also a new Pencil “hover” feature, which feels like a  really odd feature to add dedicated screen hardware for. Nice, but I think it’s going to be a hard sell to get developers adding support for it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The iPad also sees its camera shifted to the right position: at the top in landscape, not portrait. However, I can’t see anything which makes it clear if this is also the case for the iPad Pro. You would hope so, but I have the nagging feeling that the position of the charging circuitry for the magnetically-attached Pencil might rule it out. If so you can expect another update to the iPad Pro next year which shifts the charging position – again. It wouldn’t be brilliant if the cheaper iPad gets the better camera position while the professional one makes do with the weird “from the side” view you get with the current one. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apple made quite a big point in its video about Stage Manager, “released with iPad OS 16”. Of course at the moment, the best part about Stage Manager – massively improved external monitor support – isn’t there. It was, of course, demoed in the video. Hopefully it will be released soon. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s nothing there which makes it a must-have upgrade over either an M1 or previous generation iPad Pro, in my view. Yes, the performance increase is great, but until the applications are there and external display support is improved I just don’t think there’s a need for all that power. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pricing hasn’t really changed. The lowest-cost iPad Pro 11in will cost you £899. A fully laden 12.9in with 5G and 2TB of storage? £2,679. I would <strong>love</strong> to know how many of those 2TB iPad Pros Apple actually sells. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apple also sneaked in a new Apple TV4K, with an A15 Bionic chip and support for HDR10+. Oh, and best of all: a new Siri Remote which <strong>supports USB-C for charging</strong>. At last. It’s still too expensive at £149, especially compared to the $129 it costs in the US. Thank you Tories for trashing the currency. And that £149 version doesn’t come with Ethernet as standard: you have to move up to the £169 version for that, which also bumps up the storage to 128Gb. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Kim doing a drawing group with some Proper Art Friends(TM) while I have a mooch around, see old sites, and generally enjoy sitting around and doing some writing. Then do something fun in the evening and back on Sunday.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>HOWEVER… we took one look at the prices of the hotels and decided to cut it a little short, staying only on Saturday. That meant setting off at 8am to get there for 10. Plenty of time. It's only an hour and three-quarters drive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Except the M2 is closed, and there is a diversion. A diversion and a queue. A long queue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Three hours later, we're finally there. I'm pretty good in these circumstances because once there is nothing you can do about something, I relax about it all going horribly wrong. And Kim wasn't too late.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With no hotel to check into, I spent the day wandering around, going back to old haunts and sitting around. I got a decent chunk of writing done, too -- over 1200 words, which doesn't sound like much but is more than I've been doing for a while -- and managed not to drink myself into an over-caffeinated mess.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I met up with Kim after her course had finished at 4pm for a quick pint with a couple of her artist chums. Which turned into three pints. In fact, as I had sneaked one while I waited, four. I am not the kind of man who can drink four pints. More important, Kim couldn't drink three pints and drive us to the hotel, which was out at Preston Park. Hence we ended up walking back this morning in the rain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, I also had no change of clothes and no charger. So my first, slightly hungover stop was the car to pick both up, then a nearby Costa to charge my phone.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All of which makes me realise how much I have come to rely on smartphones. Instead of trusting that when we arrange to be at a place with people, we will be there, we want the belt-and-braces of being able to send a message to someone, to check where they are and if they're still coming. And it opens up the possibility, too, of <strong>not</strong> coming: if you text someone beforehand, you can just rearrange.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Reading and watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Stephen Baxter released <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781473228900\">The Thousand Earths</a></em> this week, and I have already finished it -- one of the benefits of being around for a weekend without much arranged to do is the speed at which I read (something I should remember). Like some other Baxter works, this one involves a plot that revolves around the far history of the universe, in this case, trillions of years. It's a decent read, with some good ideas, but the end feels rushed, and as with quite a few of Baxter's novels, the secondary characters feel like caricatures designed to nudge the plot in the direction he wants to go.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also started, <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781915590015\">Chokepoint capitalism</a></em> by Rebecca Giblin and Cory Doctorow. If you have been following Cory's recent blog posts about monopolies and how they come to dominate the creative landscape, you will find this familiar territory -- but of course, with a lot more detail.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A trip to the cinema while in Brighton to see <em><a href=\"https://moonagedaydream.film/\">Moonage Daydream</a></em>, a documentary about David Bowie. I love Bowie with all my glam heart, but this was an incoherent mess that went on too long despite jumping from 2000 to Bowie's death with virtually no mention (and how could you miss out Tin Machine… ok, well, that was one good thing).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Episode six of <em>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> delivered in a big way.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has been a week of tech-futzing and annoyances. I converted my ThinkPad back to running Windows because I was desperate to use Aeon Timeline for part of my writing project. That was a big mistake for two reasons. First, I could have just used my Mac to run it. I have no idea why I didn't just do that. Second, I have <strong>really</strong> grown to dislike Windows.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not, I should say, because of the interface. Windows has never looked and worked better overall. Microsoft took the opportunity with Windows 11 to get rid of some of the crufty old settings which hadn't been updated since the Windows 7 era (and in some cases, Windows XP). It's just a lot nicer to use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, they are also determined to lock in – sorry, \"integrate\" – more of their services and software into the operating system. That nifty little widgets panel offers you your task list, in Microsoft To Do. You can see news and weather, but only Microsoft News and Weather. And if you click on a link, it's opening in Edge not your browser of choice.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's clear that, like Apple, Microsoft sees services as the way to go to build revenue. Making Windows free to update probably still rankles, and they would like some revenue back, please. But that kind of stuff is not for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Mac, too, is frustrating me for a few reasons. Don't get me wrong: there is so much to love about the Mac, and my M1 Mac mini continues to be a delight. But again, it feels like a system that is becoming something Apple controls rather than me controlling it, and when things go wrong they often take far more futzing about to fix than they should.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Case in point: I'm currently sitting in a coffee shop using the very fast internet here to do some big downloads. Except that my Mac won't properly connect to the WiFi. Apple uses its own system process to handle connecting to wireless networks which require authentication, showing you a little mini-window for you to login.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Except that it doesn't always appear. Sometimes, when you have connected using another device, it connects, but doesn't bring up the window – and because the network sees the Mac as another device it doesn't properly connect. It claims to have connected, but it doesn't log in, so you have no connectivity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes all you need to do is turn WiFi on and off and it will work properly. Sometimes that doesn't work, and you need to restart. And sometimes, like today, it just will not connect no matter what you do. I have even tried invoking the system application which does the captive WiFi connection, with no result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is probably a preference somewhere which will fix this. Maybe there is some cache that needs clearing. But whatever it is, nothing on the internet helps.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That's very different to the world of Linux, where almost every problem you will ever encounter has been solved by someone and documented. The only problem I've ever found which doesn't have a fix is, ironically, running Aeon Timeline in Wine. But to be fair, I never really tried particularly hard – and if I find a solution, you can bet that I'm going to document it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And I still hate the MacBook Pro keyboard. Yes, I know that new MacBooks have reverted to sane key switches, but when I have tried them they still feel crap to me. Not as crap, but still crap. I'm now used to a mechanical keyboard, and only something as good as the ThinkPad's keyboard suffices on a laptop. I have turned to the dark side.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a more serious and less grumpy point to all this. I'm growing increasingly uncomfortable with the integration which Apple and Microsoft are focusing on. It's not that the services are bad – in Apple's case, at least, they are excellent – it's that putting your entire computing life in the hands a single supplier seems like a bad idea. You only need to look at what happened to the man who Google believed had abused his children to see how bad it can get.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And I'm less happy too to have all my documents stored in the cloud. It is hugely convenient. It means that for about a decade I haven't had to think about backing up, as everything is in iCloud or OneDrive and easily accessible. But it also feels like I am putting too much in the hands of companies which I don't really trust.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thankfully, at some point I have connected my phone to this WiFi and it is happily reconnecting, because the network recognises it. So I downloaded a nearly 6Gb file on my iPhone, and had to transfer it to the Mac later. Thankfully AirDrop did the job well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So I lost a day to reinstalling Linux. I know. I know. This time, rather than Ubuntu, I went for the Ubuntu-derived Zorin OS. It's designed to be as simple as possible to pick up for Linux novices and I think it hits that mark well. It includes nice little features like making using Windows applications easier by letting you just double-click on an installer while it adds Wine in the background.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This weekend is when the first tranche of new students arrives at the University, so the coffee shop I was writing in is full of parents taking their children for a coffee before they head back to whatever corner of the country they have come from. Outside the window there's the constant bustle of wheeled bags going past, and our close will have more than one car load of people circle round it, with a parent saying \"I don't think this is the university…\" before going back and finding the real thing. We should put up a sign.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's fun listening to the guy who works here ask each parent in turn if they have had far to come, telling them there's more seating downstairs, pointing them in the direction of the shop or the library or Sainsbury or wherever they are off to next. Then there are the small groups of students who are obviously new, meeting for the first time and going for a coffee to chat. Or to sit awkwardly in semi-silence.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It brings back memories of my own first trip to college when my dad drove me down to Hatfield. Unlike many families I see, my mother didn't make the journey: she was upset that the last of her babies was leaving home, and didn't want me to see her cry. She also gave my dad strict instructions that he was not to use the M1 and to use the A1 instead, because motorway drivers were madmen and she didn't want him to drive at the crazy speed of 70 miles an hour.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has been a terrible writing week. I have struggled to get my head down and write. I don't have any excuses: I have a good idea where the story is going and I have had the time available to keep writing, but I just… haven't.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Reading and watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> is actually very good. The characters and (especially) plot are better than Tolkien, who I tried to reread a while ago and found dreadful. Like a lot of people I read <em>Lord of the Rings</em> young, and raced through all three books in a week or two. I vividly remember staying up late and reading it in bed, gripped by it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sadly I haven't retained that love – or perhaps I have just grown into better writing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

However, he hasn't let himself be limited to this, playing with the forms of the modern novel and writing things which have as much in common with Iain Sinclair as Edgar Rice-Burroughs. His real theme isn't fantasy, but the fantastical, something which can be found in everyday life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Tolkien was the worst thing to happen to fantasy</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I might be exaggerating: I am sure that even Moorcock would say that other writers (<em>cough</em> Hubbard, Lovecraft <em>cough</em>) were worse people and worse writers.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wrote a little about this in my <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2022/09/04/weeknote-sunday-4th-september-2022/\">weeknote</a> but I thought it was worth expanding a little on why I'm looking at <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> as a potential replacement for <a href=\"https://ulysses.app/\">Ulysses</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've used Ulysses since it first came out, and it is my favourite writing tool. I love the way it lets you break down writing into smaller more manageable chunks, as well as its focus and typewriter modes and its ability to tag and organise your work. It can also publish straight to a WordPress blog or export into virtually any format you want, which is the icing on the cake.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The part that I don't like is the way Ulysses stores your work. Yes, underneath everything, it's Markdown. But it's stored in iCloud, and the files aren't exposed -- they're hidden inside a library. I have enough experience trying to get large amounts of content out of cryptic file stores to be wary of anything which complicates the file structure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Case in point: Apple's Photos app. The photos themselves are hidden inside a library. You can export them from Photos -- Apple makes this commendably easy -- but in practice, for a library of any size this kind of export is impossible. I tried exporting around 10,000 images, and after a while, Photos just crapped out. Perhaps that was unsurprising, given it had started to use around 80Gb of virtual memory (it's a testament to Apple's system design that it had gotten that far).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The last thing I want is my writing to suffer the same fate. My writing is probably even more important to me than my photos. I have often found inspiration in going back and finding old writing, reworking and polishing it, and publishing. I also use Ulysses for storing notes and what I call \"fragments\" -- little notes usually from real life about places, people and things I see. Often these will end up in later work, which is really important. I don't want to lose them to weird data corruption affecting an undocumented and obscure library.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Coupled with this, Ulysses is an Apple platform-only application. That's fine if you want to use Mac, iPad and iPhone all the time, but that's not how I tend to work. Since I bought my ThinkPad X1 Carbon last year, it has been my preferred laptop, running either Windows or Linux, because it combines good (matte) 14in screen, performance and battery life, and its fantastic keyboard. Going back to using my 16-in MacBook Pro after working on the ThinkPad is torture for my poor fingers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I really want Ulysses, but working on any platform and using just plain Markdown files in a folder structure. The good thing is there is something which comes close to being exactly that: Obsidian.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Obsidian is best known for being part of the wave of personal knowledge management applications that allow you to use two-way linking between documents to create a knowledge graph based on what you read and write. However, it's also possible to use it to create a simple but powerful writing environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Setting up for writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Obsidian isn't known for being a writing environment. It's designed as a notetaking application, and out of the box that's what it's set up to do: text notes linked together with two-way links. Turning it into a replacement for Ulysses takes some setup.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news is that several people have gone down this path already. <a href=\"https://curtismchale.ca/\">Curtis McHale</a> has written and created YouTube videos on all the things you need to do to get Obsidian into shape as a writing environment, and the folks at <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/turning-obsidian-into-my-perfect-writing-app/\">The Sweet Setup</a> have also trod this path.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You will want to install a few add-ons to make it work. I won't go into how you enable third-party add-ons, as there are plenty of guides to doing this, but here are all the ones that I have found useful.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Longform</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a great addon, still very much in beta, which recreates Scrivener and Ulysses' ability to let you re-order scenes and then export them into a single draft. I'm sure there's more to come from this plugin, but it's already a lifesaver that makes it possible to use Obsidian for long-form writing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Pandoc</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pandoc lets you export into various formats, including Word, PDF, and much more. You will need this if you send your work off to publishers or editors. You will need to install Pandoc on your computer first (sadly, it won't work with mobile devices).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Templater</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Templater lets you create templates which include variables. I use it to make templates for regular posts, such as the one for my weeknote, which includes the date in its title.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Typewriter Scroll</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I love typewriter scrolling -- it's one of my favourite features of Ulysses. This keeps the line you're typing in the middle of the screen rather than gradually moving down towards the bottom. This plugin also has a neat focus mode which greys out paragraphs you're not working on, allowing you better focus.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3>Word sprint</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This plug adds a sidebar which gives you a Pomodoro timer for your work and prompts you to keep writing. It's a little bit annoying, but if you're the kind of person (like me) who occasionally stops writing to stare into space, it will keep you on the right path.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Readwise integration</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One plugin I thought deeply about using was the one that offers integration with Readwise. I've been a Readwise user for quite a while, with all of my annotations, highlights and comments from applications like Kindle, Matter, Pocket and more going into it. It's a great tool for storing all that kind of information. The plugin downloads all your notes in a handy format into a folder in your Obsidian vault.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having all my highlights and notes from Readwise integrated into the application I write in is incredibly powerful. It means that all the quotes which I might refer to are easily found and linked to, and because Obsidian allows you to split the screen and use two documents at the same time you can easily refer to a note about a source while you are writing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Overall…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Can Obsidian really replace Ulysses? The initial signs are promising. Today, I have written over two thousand words and published a blog post which isn't bad going. I'll probably save this to publish another time, which means I will have another post in the bag.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The real test for me will be when I start writing fiction with it. So far, I have used Scrivener or Ulysses for my fiction: Obsidian could, in theory, replace both. It can also become where I put all those fragments of writing I mentioned. I'm certainly going to give it a go and see if it really works for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Two years ago I wrote: Do you get the sense that Google, company-wide, is all that interested in Android? I don’t. Both as the steward of the software platform and as the maker of Pixel hardware, it seems like Google is losing interest in Android. Flagship Android hardware makers sure are interested in Android, but they can’t move the Android developer ecosystem — only Google can. Apple, institutionally, is as attentive to the iPhone and iOS as it has ever been. I think Google, institutionally, is bored with Android. Nothing in the last two years has changed my mind on that. Android is certainly still a thing for Google. It’s a priority. But it’s nowhere near the top of Google’s priorities. Nothing ranks higher amongst Apple’s priorities than the iPhone and iOS. Year after year, that difference in prioritization adds up.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There's clearly a difference in importance between Apple and Google. Google created Android initially because it feared a Microsoft-dominated mobile world where the big beast of Redmond could lock them out of the nascent smartphone ads market. Apple created the iPhone to be the next big thing, something they could charge their usual margins of 30%+ on hardware.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But saying Google is \"bored\" of Android is wide of the mark. Both Android 13 and the forthcoming iOS 16 are similar in the way they fill in the gaps. Neither offers anything radical. Apple is revamping the lock screen, which is nice but overdue. Google extends its nice \"Material You\" tricks, which balance the interface's colours with the wallpaper.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Both operating systems have really reached what you might call the Windows 7 era: users don't particularly want radical change because they like the way things work now.

Seeing friends, listening to talks, having fun -- all the kinds of social stuff that previously were part of everyday life just vanished for a while. And, worse: it takes time to get used to doing them again. It's not just a case of returning to normal, as the \"new normal\" was something we all got used to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Afterwards, we took a long stroll down to the South Bank and went for a drink in the Royal Festival Hall. It wasn't the first time I've been to the RFH since the \"official\" end of the pandemic, but it was great to go up to the member's bar and look out over the Thames, something I used to do a lot when I worked just across the river.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I've been trying out <a href=\"https://obsidian.md\">Obsidian</a> for my writing. My favourite writing app is Ulysses, but it has two issues: it's only available on Apple devices and stores its files in an opaque way on iCloud. I would like something that's cross-platform and which uses plain simple files in a regular directory -- and Obsidian fits the bill for this. I tried it out a couple of years ago and didn't like it because of its lack of a proper live preview as you write (unlike my friend Jason Snell I don't want to see the Markdown all the time).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The way I tend to work involves a lot of quick note-taking. I have always been a jotter, writing down descriptions of people, places and events and quickly putting down any ideas I have. This is mostly out of necessity: I have a terrible memory. I always have thought it's one of the reasons I made a good news writer because my bad memory meant I had to quickly get into the habit of writing everything down.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This means a good mobile client is essential, and Obsidian has one. It lacks Ulysses' integration with the share sheet, but I have other tools I can use to save items, which means they end up in Obsidian.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Out of the box, though, Obsidian is a pretty poor writing environment. It lacks things I have come to rely on, like focus and typewriter writing modes, the ability to export as Word documents, and even the ability to break down a piece of writing into sections, dragging and dropping them into the right order. This last one is absolutely essential for fiction, where I tend to write in small discreet scenes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news is that Obsidian is infinitely extensible using plugins and has a great community behind it who have built almost everything you could want. There's a Longform plugin which lets you write and reorder scenes. There are typewriter scrolling and focus modes and Pandoc for exporting in virtually any format you could want. There are even plugins for footnotes and activity trackers so you can keep an eye on writing progress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing I definitely like is the way you can use templates in Obsidian. It's a very powerful system that, with the addition of the Templater add-on, lets us use things like variables in a template.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are considering using Obsidian for more than just note-taking, I recommend <a href=\"https://curtismchale.ca/\">Curtis McHale's site</a>. Curtis has done a huge amount of work digging through the plugins and has many videos recommending the best stuff for writers, whether you're creating long or short form, fiction or non-fiction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>About 750 words on a short story which has been newly renamed <em>Abigail Harvey returns home</em>.

Instead, Google has built its own proprietary encryption extensions on RCS. Unfortunately, they only work if you use Google servers for messaging and with Google's Messages app. Although Google has published top-level technical papers, there is no way that open clients, or Apple, can support Google's proprietary encryption at this point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The comments on that Android Police article prove just how well Google's PR campaign is landing with some -- and how important it is for tech sites to start getting this right. The comments are full of people talking about how Apple is stopping messages from being secure by not adopting RCS as if it was part of the open standard that Apple could adopt. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Now, of course, I am sure Google would be \"happy to work with\" Apple to support its proprietary encryption. But that would mean Apple effectively handing over control over messaging standards not to a standards body but to Google. Anyone who thinks that is likely to happen doesn't know Apple. And anyone who says it <strong>should</strong> happen doesn't don't know Google.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Google wants to encourage the adoption of RCS because it offers another platform for advertising. And although messages sent between Android users (using Google's app) are encrypted, and Google can't read the content, it can track who you are messaging, which gives it a significant data point about who your social circle is. In addition, that gives it data about the strength of relationships in your social graph, which it hasn't had much insight into since the decline of email as a personal communication method.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Adopting RCS, of course, also counters the real target of Google's strategy here: Meta. WhatsApp is wildly popular, particularly outside the US, and Meta bought it in the first place to get access to that social graph data about who you message most often. So Google needs a counter, and RCS adoption -- with its proprietary extensions -- is what it is pinning its hopes on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Unfortunately, the last couple of episodes lost their way a bit. Having focused on humour and fun in the first few, it was hard to turn it around when things got darker later. The murder of Nancy by Sid and Sid's subsequent death just don't lend themselves to lightness. Looking at the series as a whole, the episode which focuses on the back story to the song \"Bodies\" is the pivot: things got a bit scary for the Pistols, and the series reflects that. All that said, the performances are great: no one looks like their character physically, but absolutely nails the characteristics.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I missed last week's week note because I was sick: I had been coughing for a few days and generally felt tired and run down. I managed to work through it from Monday to Wednesday, but Thursday decided that I had to take a day off work in the hope that a bit of rest would set me back on my feet. In fact, Friday was worse. The cough continued and I felt absolutely exhausted.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This has been affecting Kim too and at one point on Friday we had decided that this might be something which only antibiotics were going to clear, and so we would call the doctor today (our doctor doesn't work weekends, but there are emergency services in place). I even looked up what the symptoms were of TB. That's how bad I felt. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On Friday night I had a terrible night's sleep, unable to sleep until about 2am, but on Saturday morning I woke up and for the first time in a week felt vaguely human. I am still not entirely well, but I don't feel the kind of levels of awful that I didn't. I am still coughing, but instead of being a long, hacking thing it's now, as the doctors say, \"productive\" – a sign, I'm told, of being on the mend.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that meant that finally – after what seems like but probably wasn’t a whole week of being cooped up – I got to go out, down to Whitstable for a couple of hours. First coffee in <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/shop/Blueprint\">Blueprint</a>, which has both good coffee and the kind of tiny collection of well-curated books which makes me whimper with delight, and then to <a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/shop/HarbourBooks\">Harbour Books</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Harbour is probably my favourite bookshop in the world. Its collection is <strong>incredibly</strong> well pieced together, with particular prominence to women writers of all kinds. It’s the first general bookshop I’ve seen where there are more women authors on display than men, and that’s incredibly gratifying. What I love about it is that I’m absolutely certain to find a book in there I have not heard of but instantly want to read, often from a new author. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All this lead to a couple of hours of pleasure: sitting in the garden on a bright evening, with a cup of tea and a book to read.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":783,\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/86165e0d99.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-783\"><figcaption>My view from a garden chair (book missing)</figcaption></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781785788116\">Buyer Beware</a></em> by Sian Conway-Wood. There are lots of slightly hokey books that I’ve read about consuming less. This is the first one which I’ve seen which not only tackles how to consume less, but looks at both the psychological tricks which manufacturers and retailers used to get you to consume more <strong>and</strong> takes a view on the way that capitalism itself is structured. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next in the never-ending book stack is Julian Barnes’ <em><a href=\"https://uk.bookshop.org/a/5025/9781787333932\">Elizabeth Finch</a></em>, which I’m actively having to stop myself from diving into instantly (“finish the book you’re reading first, Betteridge!”). You probably already know Barnes is a great writer, but if you don’t, then you <strong>really</strong> need to know it. There’s an old phrase from Clive James who wrote “all I can do is turn a phrase until it catches the light”, and although James was writing about himself (writing about himself was really most of what he did) it could have been about Barnes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Writing…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Very much curtailed this week. Writing is one of the things which suffers badly when I’m ill, particularly when I’m trying to fight through it and work. If I work when I’m ill, which I did for the first three days of the week, then I don’t have any energy at all to write in the evening.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What I did manage to write on Saturday was a small wall of angry social media posts. The demise of <em>Roe vs Wade</em> in the US affects many friends and hundreds of millions of women, and it fills my heart with anger and sadness. It put me in mind of Peggy Seeger’s <em>Song of Choice</em>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p><em>In January you've still got the choice</em></p>\n<p><em>You can cut the weeds before they start to bud</em></p>\n<p><em>If you leave them to grow high they'll silence your voice</em></p>\n<p><em>And in December you may pay with your blood…</em></p>\n<p><em>The weeds are all around us and they're growing</em></p>\n<p><em>It'll soon be too late for the knife</em></p>\n<p><em>If you leave them on the wind that around the world is blowing</em></p>\n<p><em>You may pay for your silence with your life</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We – I – believed for far too long that the progress we had made on women’s rights, gay rights, trans rights, the rights of minorities was part of a forward march of progress which could never be revoked. Roe vs Wade is the first large-scale unwinding of that, the literal cancelling of a fundamental right for women. We didn’t cut the weeds of fascism early enough, and now we have to work harder to clear them before, as Peggy wrote, it’s too late for the knife. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Watching…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>Pistol</em>, Danny Boyle’s utterly brilliant and completely batshit story of the Sex Pistols.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the many useful things about writing a week note is it give you a regular reminder that life is as much about doing as thinking about doing. But this week has been a lot of watching and tinkering: with WWDC happening and new releases of iOS, iPadOS and macOS, my inner nerd has emerged like a raging hulk.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every year I tell myself I won’t race to install the first developer releases of all the new operating systems. Every year, within 24 hours, I’ve become too excited to wait until the public betas. This year was no exception, particularly because the new version of iPadOS offers the feature which I have been wanting for years: proper support for second monitors.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And Stage Manager for iPadOS really will be that most clichéd of things: a game changer, at least for me. I have preferred using the iPad as a device over the Mac for years. However, I haven’t been able to do use it as my main machine because it doesn’t work on a screen size that I’m comfortable using for a long time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m not going to write in detail about iPadOS 16 just yet — I think it deserves a post of its own — but this year might be the one where I finally give up on having a Mac laptop and just use the iPad as my portable Apple device. There are drawbacks, even though the software is almost in the right place, but the advantages now eclipse those drawbacks. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve gone back to one of my most annoying reading habits: being unable to settle on what book I want to read next, so bouncing from book to book without really feeling I’m achieving much reading. So this week I’m going to settle on A. L. Kennedy’s <em>On Writing</em>, which I have been flirting with for a while. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Writing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a massively mediated society, understanding how media works is incredibly important if people are to avoid being controlled by what they read, see and hear. I have worked in publishing now for 27 years, which always feels weird when I say it, so I have picked up a lot about how media works. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is why I’m on a bit of a mission to educate people more about publishing in general and reporting and editing in particular. It struck me when reading Twitter that most people don’t understand what an “editorial line” is and how it interacts with what you see and hear. So I wrote something on <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2022/06/11/what-is-an-editorial-line/\">what an editorial line is</a>, to hopefully help people understand it a bit more.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Watching</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you haven’t watched the first episode of <em>Ms Marvel,</em> you are missing out on a treat. I think of it and <em>Wandavision</em> as the opposite ends of the scale for how Marvel treats its TV shows. <em>Wandavision</em> was incredibly clever and genuinely frightening, with an impact across the whole of the MCU. <em>Ms Marvel</em> is funny, smart, and endearing. After the mess that was <em>Moon Knight</em>, it’s a great comeback. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Meanwhile, on the internet…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The situation at the Washington Post with <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/06/inside-the-washington-posts-social-media-meltdown\">reporters attacking each other on social media</a> sounds like an absolute mess. I have an elementary rule about work and social media: I don’t talk about work on social media. I don’t even mention the business I work for on social media. Same rules here: I’ll never talk about my work. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Occasionally, that makes writing these week notes challenging! I spend 37.5 hours of every week working, none of which I will talk about here. That, at least, means I have to push myself to talk about the more personal side of my life. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, back in the real world, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jun/08/time-and-money-why-londoners-refuse-to-drop-working-from-home\">Londoners don’t particularly want to return to the office</a>. I’m not surprised at all — the notion of going to a place to work is weird unless your work physical requires you to be there. For any kind of what we used to call “knowledge worker”, who spends their life on a computer all day, the internet makes that pointless. Rethinking the role of the office is vital, but the government can also play a part by improving <strong>and</strong> cutting the cost of public transport. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

And a trade it is -- despite the best efforts of all involved in my working education, I'll never think of journalism as a profession. But like all trades, it has its methods and modes of action, and people who aren't journalists often don't know what they are. One of the elements we don't talk about is the <em>editorial line</em>, what it is, and how it manifests itself in publications.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An editorial line is a set of beliefs about <em>what</em> is essential to your audience and desires to make that audience understand that certain things <em>are</em> important. Good journalism is balancing the two. Journalism which is only about what the audience cares about, is really just entertainment. Journalism which is only about what you believe is vital for the audience to start thinking about, is really just propaganda.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Editorial lines have an impact in two places. First, there's the selection of stories you choose to publish. \"Magazine\" comes from the Middle French word \"magasin\", which means a warehouse or store, and like a warehouse, it's a collection of disparate things chosen by humans. And, also like a warehouse, it's not finite: you can't publish every possible story. So instead, you must decide what stories to put together in your collection. So you are always choosing which stories to publish based on that balance of what the audience wants and what you believe is important for the audience to know or believe.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second place the editorial line manifests is in the angle of the story. Every story has an angle, a direction which the writer wishes to take the reader along. Although the first duty of any reporter is to report the facts, you can't write all the facts: facts are interlinked and often rely on more facts to prove they are true. So you have to choose what facts to report.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And, of course, you have to interest the reader, which means moving them along in the story, keeping them engaged with it as you go. This is why salaciously-written stories are often so successful: salacious comes from the word <em>salire</em>, which means to leap on something with lust. Salire is also the root of <em>salient,</em> as in \"the salient point\" -- something all good reporters get to as quickly as possible to draw the reader into the story.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How you draw people into a story -- how you choose which points are salient, whether something needs to be salacious, and so on -- depends on the editorial line. But, of course, you might not have an explicit editorial line on every topic. Still, you have a good idea of what the audience is interested in, which is how the audience feels about the world and what things your publication believes they need to care about more (or less). Based on that, you can understand what points are salient to them in a story.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are editorial lines set by the politics of the owner and editor? Partly: but more important in any publication is the politics of the intended audience. Remember, you're not trying to brainwash them: if you are, then you are propagandists, not journalists.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

All of this compounded Apple’s repair-hostile design: swapping the battery requires three different screwdriver bits, removing the speaker, and managing a cluster of hidden fasteners that hold down the fiddly ribbon cables. Apple’s official tools don’t have (industry standard) magnetic tips, so Hollister spent a lot of time chasing minuscule pieces of metal around his workbench.\"</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s tough to see Apple’s self-repair programme as anything but, as Cory puts it, “repairwashing”.

The company has the best industrial designers in the world.

It was one of the first pieces I wrote which appeared online, and it's probably one of the angriest things I've ever written. Although reading the Wired piece back I think I might have been a bit harsh, I think I on to something. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Originally published on <em>Rewired, </em>July 7<sup>th</sup> 1997</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/1997/07/longboom/\">Wired 5.07</a> arrived late in Britain, a couple of weeks after it had first hit the streets of San Francisco. When it did make it, when I finally got around to reading Peter Schwartz and Peter Leyden's cover feature, my reaction was that if they wanted to print a piece of science fiction, why didn't they get Arthur C. Clarke to write it?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The biggest problem with the feature is that Schwartz, whose well-known views frame the article, only wants to think to one level of difficulty, and his determination to be optimistic makes him refuse to think beyond that. For example, technology will save the environment because \"infotech... makes much less impact on the natural world.\" And yes, at the simplest level he's right -- the environmental impact of sending something digitally rather than via FedEx is lower.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this ignores the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20011005162213/http://www.factory.org/nettime/archive-1996/0315.html\">environmental cost</a> of creating the infrastructure in the first place. Where do all those plastics used in PCs come from? How much water is wasted and polluted in the process of PC and chip manufacture? Problems like these are simply ignored by Schwartz, who would presumably just wave his magic techno-wand and make them go away.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another example is transportation; Schwartz sings the praises of the hydrogen cell. He ignores the technological problems that need to be solved -- fair enough, within the boundaries of this work of \"speculation\" -- but then claims that \"the only waste product [is] water.\" Yes, at the end of the line -- from the car itself -- that's true. But what are the waste products of producing the hydrogen cells in the first place? What is the environmental impact of all that additional water in the atmosphere?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An even worse error is ignoring the impact of the simple production of more cars. When the combined populations of China and India are rich enough to afford the Western standard of a car or two (or more) per family, then you have an awful lot of steel, aluminium, and copper to find somewhere. What's the impact of the additional mining, smelting, more factories, and so on? These issues, the less obvious ones, are the most important of all -- and Schwartz ignores them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To add insult to injury, the cover line, \"We're facing 25 years of prosperity, freedom and a better environment for the whole world,\" doesn't even reflect the feature. Schwartz's approach to Africa is typical of this; while the developed world gets ever richer, Africa gets biological warfare, ethnic conflict, and increased poverty (except, of course, in 'enlightened' South Africa). The only solution is the eventual intervention of the rest of the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Yeah, of course what Africa really needs is more intervention from white men. As if the West's interventions in Africa for the past 300 years haven't been damaging enough. Schwartz appears to see the problems of Africa in total isolation from the rest of the world, as if the exploitation of African resources by the West wasn't continuing to damage the African economy -- and, incidentally, provide us rich folk with some of the cheap commodities we take for granted. As if the problems of Africa could be cured by a quick dose of Western culture. As if \"enlightened\" multinational companies didn't continue to <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20011005162213/http://www.rewired.com/97/0414.html\">prop up</a> oppressive dictatorships in order to ensure that business continues smoothly -- without the troublesome peasants complaining about the destruction of their livelihoods and environment in the race for \"progress\".</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Schwartz is just as dumb about Europe, and is particularly naive about Britain. Yes, Britain's official unemployment rate is much lower than much of the rest of Europe's -- but that has more to do with the way that successive governments have massaged the figures, rather than any huge reduction in unemployment. School leavers, people on training schemes, anyone over 55 -- all are excluded from the figures, which makes our level look marvellous. A better measure might have been the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20011005162213/http://www.oecd.org/\">OECD's</a> economic rankings, which Britain has been sliding down for two decades, or that the poorest 10% of Britain's people are poorer in real terms than they were 20 years ago (while the richest 1% are much, much richer).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But Schwartz evidently doesn't keep up with European news. Far from Britain being the only \"laggard\" in the race towards the single European currency, it looks likely that no one will be ready for 1999. Even Germany and France, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20011005162213/http://www.slate.com/GlobalPrimer/97-06-10/GlobalPrimer.asp\">the two bulwarks of the Euro</a>, are set to fail to meet the economic criteria for entry into the single currency. Schwartz would claim that this is due to their welfare state systems; others, perhaps less ideologically committed to the destruction of welfare states, might point to the crazy cost of pan-European initiatives like the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20011005162213/http://europa.eu.int/en/eupol/agren.htm\">Common Agricultural Policy</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But all that can be avoided by that old fashioned panacea, \"strong leadership\". Yes, the people of Europe must suffer when their welfare systems are dismantled, and if they complain strong leaders will push them forward. No matter what they want, this is good for them. This is where Schwartz starts to turn the stomach, but it gets worse.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The crisis in China caused by the difference in wealth between the city dwellers and the peasantry is avoided, by authorities \"occasionally using draconian measures\". This offhand way of describing torture and oppression sickens. I wonder whether Peter has ever read an <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20011005162213/http://www.amnesty.org/ailib/countries/indx317.htm\">Amnesty International report about China</a>, where one of the favorite \"draconian methods\" is to insert an electric \"crowd control baton\" (read as \"cattle prod\") into the vagina or anus and turn it on, full blast?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps in the big picture world that Schwartz lives in, such oppression doesn't matter. After all, if you can convince yourself that utopia is just around the corner, that all we have to do is be optimistic, then it'll all be worth it in the end. Sure, this Long March will have some casualties, but what revolution is bloodless? The fact that, once again, the casualties will be the poorest and weakest people in the world doesn't appear to matter to him.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the \"Goofy Leftists Sniping at Wired\" topic in <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20011005162213/http://www.well.com/\">The Well's </a>Wired conference, I called Wired's revolution \"a nasty Victorian counter-revolution\". Schwartz' feature typifies that new Victoriana, with its attitude to Africa with its calls for \"strong leadership\", with its optimism about progress, and ironically, given the \"global\" nature of Schwartz' vision, its flag waving for a particular nation. Yes, the dear old USA, the country that's \"first among equals\" must lead the way into this techno-utopia, guiding those backward folks in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just as Britain saw itself as the guardian of the world's affairs in the last century, a shining beacon of civilization that would bring order and good conduct to the world, so the strong leadership of the US will enlighten us all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well excuse me, Peter, but some of us want no part of another age of Victorians. Some of us \"just don't get it\"; and don't want it, either.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

I went through a phase in the noughties of running it, partly inspired by the moves from Mark Pilgrim and Cory Doctorow, and for a while, I used a boxy fat Dell Inspiron running Ubuntu. That wasn't a great experience: Ubuntu was renowned at the time for its ease of use and friendliness to non-technical users, but all too often, I found myself having to dig into command lines and tweak drivers. Unlike Cory, I didn't have <a href=\"https://johnvidler.co.uk/linux-journal/LJ/175/10197.html\">a hotline into Canonical</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I headed back to using the Mac because there were just too many rough edges around using Linux, and the applications available weren't as good as those I was used to. For example, I <strong>hated</strong> OpenOffice, which looked like an old and clunky version of Microsoft Word. In fact, most of the software I was using looked like something from the late 1990s, the time before user interface design was done by designers, rather than coders moonlighting with a copy of Paint.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Times change. An awful lot of what I do on a day to day basis can be done on Linux. The application I do most of my writing in (Typora) has a Linux version. Firefox has recently become my primary browser. Microsoft has <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/download-app#allDevicesSection\">a version of Teams for Linux</a>, which means I can use a Linux machine for my day job.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I recently bought a new Windows machine, I bought a ThinkPad X1 Carbon because I knew I wanted to try Linux out again, and it's a great laptop to run it on. You can buy the model that I purchased with Ubuntu pre-installed rather than Windows (and I was pretty tempted at the time). It's massively over-specified for a Linux laptop, with an 11th generation i7, 32Gb of RAM and a 1Tb SSD, but this means it's also a computer which could last me a long time, especially if I'm not being driven along by the endless hardware upgrade cycle which Microsoft and its partners would love to see you on.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With all that in mind, I decided that the time was right to dip my toes back into the world of Linux. So, after watching a few videos about the various distributions available, I downloaded and installed Zorin OS, a pretty Mac-like experience. It's also very beginner-friendly: it even includes an ingenious way of handling Windows applications by installing Wine and any required supporting files when you first click on a Windows installer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The installation experience was as smooth as you would expect: Linux distributions are now mature and stable enough that installing on anything but peculiar hardware will be easy. It lets me quickly partition my drive, splitting it between Windows and Linux. It was then a quick task to customise the interface to look more Mac-like, install the applications I wanted, and away I went.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then two days later, I changed my mind and decided I wanted to use the latest Long Term release of Ubuntu instead. Canonical issues a new long-term support version of Ubuntu every year, which guarantees five years of updates and support. LTS releases tend to be stable, which was also a selling point.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ubuntu 22.04 LTS uses the latest version of Gnome, which has an updated display engine which is smoother than previous versions. I also wanted to work on something as mainstream as possible. I was sold on using just Linux on my ThinkPad and getting rid of Windows altogether. The overall experience had been more than good enough, and I've fallen out of love with Windows 11. So I installed Ubuntu, taking the whole 1Tb SSD for it. Goodbye, Windows 11.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As I had expected, I've had no problems at all with hardware. In fact, some of the hardware that I had expected to have to do some fiddling and driver installation with worked immediately. For example, the fingerprint reader, which I used to log in to the machine, works just as well with Ubuntu as it did with Windows. My CalDigit Thunderbolt dock, which I use to connect to the webcam, display and a few other peripherals, also works perfectly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only place where I tripped up a little was adjusting the display to get the UI sized correctly. The display on my ThinkPad is a 16:10 panel which runs at 1920x1200. Running at the native resolution makes text and UI elements a little small; I enabled fractional sizing and bumped it up to 125%, the same as Windows runs. That works, but it leaves the text blurry - not enough to make it unusable, but annoying. The answer was to leave it running at 100% but turn on Large Text in the Accessibility options. The text was now crisp and large enough for me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And that is all the interface tweaking I've done, other than moving the dock to the bottom and making it look a little more Mac-like, all using the built-in options with no additional software installed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Operating systems should get out of the way and let you get on with the actual work you do. If you're worried about and twiddling with the OS, you're playing rather than producing. There's nothing wrong with that if you enjoy it. But for people who want to do some real work, the OS shouldn't be something you think about much.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So far, for me, Ubuntu is doing precisely that. I'm writing, not computing. I'm creating, not being bamboozled by a thousand different options. I'm delighted with it, so I really can't write much more about the experience. It's just been simple.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

The ivy has grown over it; it's evolved through it. In fact, the ivy was really all that was holding up the fence. So technically, the fence isn't ours: it belongs to our neighbour at the back. However, our neighbour at the back is a student house where the landlord really hasn't done much to maintain the garden (hence, of course, the demise of the fence). There's already one fence panel which has collapsed which he hasn't replaced. I suspect getting him to replace these will be another long, drawn-out affair.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two days in a row in London left me feeling drained. I'm not sure if it's post-covid effects or just a combination of getting older and my body not being well looked after, but I have much less energy now than I had even a handful of years ago. So the only thing to do is try and push through it as gently as possible and be more active.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For me, that means gentle walks and making more of my bike. I miss cycling: it's something that I never really took up in London but had done a lot of in Brighton and before that in St Albans. I have to keep reminding myself that it was long ago. It's about seventeen years since I moved from the coast to the city.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Adventures in Linux</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have converted my ThinkPad into a dedicated Linux computer. I always had half a mind to do this -- it is one of the reasons I went for a ThinkPad rather than a more exciting Windows laptop -- but I was surprised by how much improved Linux was since the last time I used it in anger. Then I remembered that would have been about fifteen years ago; I would be surprised if Linux hadn't improved.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, I just partitioned the drive and left Windows on there, but after a day of tinkering, I realised there was absolutely no need to keep Windows about. For emergencies, I have other Windows laptops (my gaming machine may sound like a jet engine, but it's a more than capable computer), and Linux was running more than smoothly enough.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first, I installed Zorin OS, an excellent distribution if you are coming from Windows and still want to run Windows apps. It has a nice feature which lets you just double click on a Windows application, and it will install Wine and any other bits and pieces you need to run it. You can also make it look like Windows 10 or 11 if you want, and it comes with plenty of software pre-installed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I decided to nuke Windows entirely, I also saw that the latest long-term support (LTS) version of Ubuntu is out, 22.04. I like LTS versions of open source software. You're not at the cutting edge of things, but it will work well for a very long time. Canonical supports LTS versions of Ubuntu for at least five years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Hence, I'm typing this using Typora, my Markdown editor for Mac and windows, which has a Linux version. I've shifted to using Firefox as my browser across the board, and there's even a version of Microsoft Teams for work. So far, so good.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ubuntu took a bit more tweaking to get looking how I wanted than Zorin did. In particular, fractional scaling (which bumps the size of the UI up and which is needed for me on a 14in 1920x1200 screen) made text annoyingly fuzzy. The answer was to keep scaling at 100% but use the accessibility features to switch to large text. I wouldn't call it large, but it's definitely bigger (I'd say about 125% of normal) and sharp.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I will write something longer about why I wanted to start using Linux again. The short version is that I'm not thrilled about the direction of travel of either Apple or Microsoft is building in more and more integration which ties you into their software and services stacks. Just using Apple or Microsoft or Google is incredibly convenient, but there might come the point where switching costs become so high that it's really impossible to do. Using Linux and open source software as much as possible is less convenient -- anyone who pretends otherwise is wrong -- but you are paying a long term price.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Related to this, I'm shifting my saved web reading from Matter to Pocket. That's no criticism of Matter as an app or a company, but I do not want to convert reading into another platform, yet another social network. Pocket is now owned by Mozilla, and I trust them to do the right thing. Also, I pay them, and I'm generally favouring paying for services rather than relying on generosity (or, more likely, advertising).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I haven't done enough reading this week, partly because I've been tired (see above).

Friday evening saw the lovely betrothal of an old friend and his darling in Kew Gardens (which has to be one of the loveliest venues to get married in). It was first due to happen in April 2020... and obviously that couldn’t go ahead. Third time’s a charm though. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At first it was a bit strange. This was I think the first big event with friends and family we have been to since lockdown ended, which means the first after an interregnum of two years without the kind of regular clockwork rhythm of social events which, even in my season of life, are like the heartbeat you barely notice until it’s gone.

How do you talk to people you don’t know?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Normally I suspect the answer to this would be “alcohol” but I’m not the drinker I once was. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times I’ve drunk more than a single glass of anything in the past few years.

It was too high and too thick for us to do it ourselves, so we hired in a lovely tree surgeon to do the work. He also cut down an old silver birch at the end of the garden which had died last year. While it wasn’t in danger of falling – it survived the last storm – sooner or later it was going to go and probably fall straight into one of the neighbour’s houses. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s some more work to do in the garden, trimming back a huge chunk of ivy which is gradually dragging down one of the neighbour’s fences towards our side. In theory, it’s not ours to fix. In practice, getting that particular neighbour to replace a fallen fence is such a long and arduous process that it’s just easier if we take care of it. We also need to clear back some slightly overgrown parts of that garden near the now-gone silver birch.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And once that’s done, there’s the vegetable garden at the side to deal with. For those who don’t know our house (which is almost all of you) we have three gardens: a small front garden with the standard English lawn and beds; a larger back garden with a lawn that’s mostly made of moss, some nice mixed beds and several trees, with greenhouse; and a side garden which is about large enough to put a bungalow on. This side garden was where vegetables and fruit were grown many years ago, but it now mostly grass and shrubs.

I also remember the following year's Macworld Boston keynote which Tim refers to, where the giant face of Bill Gates appeared on screen and some in the audience booed.

It’s always good to go to something which sharpens my skills a bit and makes me feel connected to the industry I make a living in.

I spend too much time cooped up indoors, and not enough time sitting on beaches.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The only downside was getting up at 5am to get there. Despite looking pretty close on the map, Brighton and Canterbury are between two and a half and three hours apart by train. It’s something I’ve said before, but Kent is a big place. It’s also quite isolated: once you get past the comfy commuter belt, it’s a generally poor place, with a lot of both rural and urban poverty. The countryside is pretty, but it’s largely working farmland, and as anyone who has lived in that kind of environment knows that means scrub, old buildings, and industrial-scale agriculture rather than pretty cottages with thatched roofs.

It’s actually mostly a piece about why Twitter is bad for journalists, and to that extent I agree with a lot of what Megan is saying. Journalists <strong>massively</strong> overestimate Twitter’s importance, largely because all their journalist friends are on it.

First, for many, winning the referendum was the first time in maybe a decade they had felt like they had any control over their lives, and were on the “winning” side. Once you have had that feeling, it takes a lot to shift you away from the position of winning: you’re emotionally attached to it in a way which is very, very deep. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Second, though: Brexit was largely delivered by the old, the conservative (small c) and less well-educated. None of those demographics are known for changing their minds often. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":697,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/0220a39e11.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-697\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What’s also interesting is how the number of people who believe we were right to leave is remarkably consistent. Yes, as of today, 49% believe we were wrong to leave compared to 39% who believe we were right, and the gap has been widening since the middle of last year, but the gap widened in 2020 to about the same amount and then bounced back. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would love to understand more about the factors moving those polls, because I think it’s almost certainly less obvious than most people think. But it’s clear that there is a rump of probably around a third of the country which believes Brexit was right no matter what the consequences they have seen so far, and are likely to believe the same in the future. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":698,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/b55fd88eb1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-698\"></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While it’s tempting to think that people are sick of hearing about it and tone down the anti-Brexit rhetoric (I’m looking at you Keir) it’s clear that the underlying attitudes and issues which are driving that 39% are going to be influencing British politics for a long time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Well, as you can see in the graph above child mortality rates declined massively from 1900 - 228 per 1000 - to 1950 (44). So those post-1950 boomer births benefitted massively from improved sanitation, vaccination, and living conditions. When Harold MacMillan said in 1957 “you’ve never had it so good”, he wasn’t lying. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But this dramatic fall between 1900 and 1950 masks a further one since: the child mortality rate in the UK is now… 4. Since 1950, we have reduced the number of children dying in early childhood by 90%. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So yes, Sylvia remembers a happy, healthy childhood.

I was born and grew up in a council house. It wasn't a bad area when I was growing up, it was definitely rough round the edges. When I did my CSE social studies and went on a court trip, it wasn't that surprising that one of our neighbours was up for soliciting. But it was classic working class – as in, most people were working, because jobs existed. Thatcher changed that, but I digress. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the houses were built, they were new and shiny and everyone wanted to be in them. They were replacements, further out of town, for the slums in the west end of Derby. And those were proper slums: back to back terraces in awful conditions built in the 18th/19th century where disease was rife, plumbing was non-existent, and there was a pub on every corner. When Marx and Engels wrote about the condition of the English working class, they could have been writing about Derby's west end.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The estate I was born on though was new, and offered a huge upgrade in living standards. There was running water in every house. Actual plumbing. A bath! Three separate bedrooms, a living room and kitchen. A front garden for roses, and a back garden to grow your vegetables. Compared to where my father had grown up, this was luxury. But: there was no central heating. No double glazing, and no insulation to speak of. There was a coal fire in the living room, and the family spent all their time there. There was a toilet – but it was outside, built into the house in a weird arrangement which meant you had to leave the house by the back door and go back in to the toilet. For the first ten years of my life, the toilet was outside, and you get used to checking if the water is frozen before you do a poo. The cold is still something I can feel. All I have to do is close my eyes and that cold comes back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It was better than working class people had before. But compared to today? It was shit. Anyone who reminisces about then as \"the good old days\" is deluding themselves. Today I sit in a nice house with double glazing and if I want a pee, I can do it in comfort and warmth. I'm not huddled around a fire on freezing mornings trying desperately to get warm, because the blankets – no duvets – never kept you warm enough at night.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>People like \"Buy British\" and others who harp on about the good old days would last about five minutes if you took away all their creature comforts. As of course would I - and that's a good thing!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is this weird attitude amongst idiots like him (and we all know it is a him) that somehow increased prosperity and better living conditions is a bad thing, that people \"don't know they're born\". It's nonsense of course. Their parents will have said the same thing of them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And of course it's all rosey-tinted bullshit. I grew up with the National Front marching on the streets, gay bashing being run of the mill, black people suffering terrible racism. Women being raped and assaulted and it never being reported. Paedophilia being so unremarkable that \"he got a 14 year old pregnant and ran off\" was a common topic of conversation (literally everyone knew a bloke who had done something like that). Families all had secrets. The food was shit too, and I could write a hole essay on how food in he old days was crap.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are no good old days. We have been lucky enough to live in a period where the standard of living has consistently improved, where the basic necessities of life of have been met in ever-better ways. And people like Buy British, with their Rosie-tinted bullshit, conspire in excusing the Tories (for it is them) who are actually now taking us backwards, in every respect. Back to an era when \"men were men and women were grateful\". Back to shit housing, poverty food (or no food). Back to when being gay was something you kept silent, or you'd suffer the consequences. Back to black people and women knowing their place and being grateful to white middles aged blokes. Well, Buy British and his chums can all just do one. I don't want that world back, because I'm old enough to remember it with clearer eyes than theirs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One more thing. I've reminded by posts like these of the wonderful scene in <a href=\"http://twitter.com/neilhimself\">Neil Gaiman</a>'s Sandman episode \"Men of good fortune\", where an old man in 1489 is complaining about how chimneys and handkerchiefs are making people soft.

I've <em>really</em> struggled with how to do this well: <a href=\"https://hq.getmatter.app\">Matter</a> (my current offline reading app of choice) isn't great at collecting together stuff which might be quite short. I hate using bookmarks for this kind of thing. And <a href=\"https://ulysses.app\">Ulysses</a>, which I used to use for a lot of writing, can collect links and has the advantage of using the iOS/MacOS share sheet but isn't really designed for it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>GoodLinks on the other hand, is perfect for this. Not only can it function as a simple, but decent, offline reader, it includes comprehensive tagging which makes content much easier to find. The way I'm working with it is to save everything that I might want to read later to it, short and long. If I read it later and decide I definitely want to write something about it, I add a star - and once I have written about it, or included it in a weeknote like this one, I remove the star so I know it's been used.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Posts at the moment usually start their life in one of two places: <a href=\"http://roamresearch.com\">Roam Research</a>, if it's an idea which needs a lot of fleshing out; or <a href=\"https://typora.io\">Typora</a> if it's something I can start drafting straight away. Actually that's not quite true: drafts or some kinds of writing start their life on the Freewrite, particularly if I'm trying to just get down something out of my head quickly. Posts which begin in Roam get exported as flat Markdown files for editing and polishing in Typora, then once I'm happy with them they are put into Ghost or Wordpress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why Typora and not a Mac/iOS app like Ulysses or IA Writer?

It's simple, unfussy, and it has a neat system which hides the Markdown until you click in it, which means it's the best of both worlds between the \"purist\" editors which show you everything (messy) and the \"simple\" ones which hide everything (annoying if you want to edit the code).

I think this is down to a set of algorithm changes that the company made last year which dramatically favoured large general news sites and local new sites over specialised information sources. The rationale behind this was explicitlly about rewarding publishers, and supporting local sources. But the result has been two fold. First, it's crowded out higher-quality specialist information sources. Second, because local news sites are overweighted, it has rewarded them for writing generic SEO-driven articles, as their content ranks highly even for topic areas which aren't local to them.

Some of the elements of it had completely slipped my mind. I'm publishing it now basically to put it to bed. It's waiting a long time. </em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On beaches, the sea delivers its bounty. Driftwood, old bits of net, occasionally even valuable items are washed up from the oceans on to the edges where sea meets land. Yet wherever there’s a seaside town, the process is reversed: human beings are washed up from the land on to the edges of the sea, attracted by casual jobs, easy sex, or the sense of freedom that inevitably comes from living by what always looks like an infinite ocean.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Wonderboy is a classic example of the kind of person that washes up in Brighton, the most glorious and transient of all British seaside towns. Escaping from a semi-feudal village in the East Midlands, that hinterland of the imagination where I too was born and bred, she moved down to live with her girlfriend after spending far too long as the real only gay in the village. That’s a common story, here. Although few other Brighton refugees have ever snorted drugs off the back of a man wearing a woman’s Tesco uniform, at least to my knowledge. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What’s less common is what happened next. She split from her girlfriend, and, returning from holiday, Wonderboy found the locks changed, her stuff in the street, and (worst of all) her prized <s>sofa’s</s>sofas sold. Other people would at this point have fled to parents or friends back home, but like many of those who wash up here, Wonderboy was made of sterner stuff. Instead, she slept on the beach, sharing cans with drunks; opened squats and lived with odd South American men; and sold henna tattoos to the tourists to make enough money to buy the essential Marlborough Reds.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We met through mutual <s>friends, and</s>friends and cemented that friendship over pints of cider at the Earth and Stars, Doctor Brighton’s, and the Marlborough, followed by early mornings dancing like idiots at Revenge. Asking her to share a flat with me was so obvious I can’t believe it took me as long as it did to ask her if, in the vernacular, she was up for it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>She said to me once that I pulled her out of the gutter, but that’s bullshit. She needed a place to live, I needed a flatmate after discovering that living on your own is very, very boring, and we got on. The person who pulled her out of the gutter was herself, because she was always ready to move on, to jump up whenever there was a chance there to be taken. All she needed was an opening. All I did was offer a chink of light.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The irony of it is that our council has actively sought to destroy the kind of peripheries that attract people like Wonderboy, in favour of the smooth, slick, New Labour vision of a family-friendly, everyone-friendly cosy little whitewashed picket fenced Islington-On-Sea. But what they don’t understand is that, no matter how many overpriced new “apartment developments” (“CITY LIVING! BY THE SEA!”) they approve, no matter how many times they try and push out the drunks, the druggies, the detritus, they’ll always fail. Because, at the end of the day, those looking for somewhere to find a little freedom will always wash up here. It’s the sea, you see.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/5b8e8571ab.jpg\"> \n",

There’s been quite a bit going on. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week our dear old cat George finally passed on to the great mouse hunting fields in the sky. Kim took her to the vet to get her checked over before renewing her prescriptions to the wide variety of chemicals that were holding her together — she didn’t have a single organ that was entirely functional, but she was happy enough gently pottering around finding places for a snooze, so we had never had to take the tricky decision to have her put to sleep. And when you are a cat and get to 19 years of age, you deserve to go on as long as you’re not in pain. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unfortunately, she didn’t survive the trip to the vets. After the check-up, she had what was probably a heart attack — she had had a heart murmur since she was five — and it was time to let her go on. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s odd not having a small creature around the place. Over the past few years she had moved from being a very independent little cat to wanting our company all the time, from hating too much human contact to wanting to be in your lap or poised on your shoulder. She’s much missed, already. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My health hasn’t been at its finest. I’ve been suffering from excessive tiredness during the day, and finally bit the bullet and saw a doctor about it a few weeks ago. Cue a referral to the sleep clinic, but routine tests also found that my blood pressure was high, and some blood tests found some minor anomalies which will need further investigation. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The worst part of the blood pressure tests is that I had to be strapped to a monitor for 24 hours, which every 20 minutes would go “beep… WHOOOSH… put… put… put… beep” as the pressure cuff inflated and checked how much of a THWACK my heart was using to slam blood down my veins. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overnight it slowed to once an hour, but try sleeping when every sixty minutes your arm is squeezed tightly — it’s not fun, and really I barely slept at all. Then I was so tired on Saturday (no sleep, remember?) that I missed the trip into London we had originally planned. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We got out to the cinema and saw <em>Nomadland</em> which was brilliant. Before the last lockdown, going to the Curzon had become a weekly treat, seeing movies which we wouldn’t normally have seen — with no blockbusters around, cinema became a very different experience. The blockbusters are coming back, but I hope that the weekly small film habit will stick.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week also saw the arrival of the new iPad Pro 12.9in, with its whizzy M1 processor which makes it embarrassingly faster than any computer in the house other than the similarly equipped Mac mini. And the Mac mini doesn’t have the incredible screen which this iPad has. In theory, you shouldn’t be able to notice much difference compared to the previous generation. In practice, it just looks better every time I look at it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It will be interesting to see what Apple has in store at WWDC in a few weeks time, when we might finally see the improvements to iPadOS which make it more of an option as a Mac replacement, rather than a powerful but slightly haphazard cousin.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

And try and open up another application so you can do something else on the iPad while watching that movie, and up will pop the application you just opened on the big screen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bear in mind that the processor on the iPad that I’m using – last year’s 12.9in iPad Pro – is a pretty powerful thing. And the iPad can do lots of things at the same time: I can have music playing, watch something using Picture in Picture, have two apps on split screen and another one via SlideOver, all cramped on to the iPad’s screen, and it will work perfectly. What I absolutely can’t do have anything on a monitor that’s not mirrored, unless the developer has worked to create an extended view – which most don’t – and even then I can’t really do much else at the same time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here’s what you can do: open up the TV app (or any other application which supports something on an external display.

This time around of course things are different. Although we are out of the first phase of lockdown, there are still limits on how many people we can meet, and where we can meet them. The shops and pubs remain shut. The grand commercial part of our social lives remains under firm lock and key.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, keeping traditions alive we piled into the car and headed for the coast, a few tens of miles down to Margate. For those expecting mass disobedience and bad behaviour, you’re going to be disappointed. It was quiet: compared to a normal Easter Bank Holiday it had perhaps a tenth of the number of people. With temperatures reaching the giddy heights of 12 degrees we didn’t stay too long, but long enough to remind me how much I love the sight of the sea. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week has been very much like every other week over the past year, a long parade of working from home, being at home, focusing on the home and avoiding contact with the rest of humanity beyond these four walls. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Last week, though, I was vaccinated. I went along to the Odeon cinema, where I’ve seen many a Marvel epic, and in the spot where I’ve waited for a screen to open while chomping away on the world’s worst nachos I waited to be shown through to have AstraZeneca’s wonder drug injected into my arm. It felt incredibly emotional: not so much because the end of this awful pandemic is in sight, although I’m glad enough for that, but for the kindness of the volunteers, spending free time guiding us around, for the pharmacist who injected me underneath the disused Pick N Mix display. Because collectively, we have done a wonderful thing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What Boris Johnson doesn’t want to say is that the AZ vaccine exists and was deployed successfully so quickly not because “greed is good” but when the government invested hundreds of millions of our money into making it happen faster. That we can do this kind of thing through collective action rather than fierce individualism isn’t a lesson that we should forget.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are so many other challenges that need this level of attention, most notably climate change. The way of life we have “enjoyed” (in places) over the past 150 years is over.

Either we choose to change it, or climate change changes it for us. Things are not going to be the same.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Related: I’m currently reading Naomi Klein’s <em>This Changes Everything</em>. Klein, not to be confused with the COVID-denying conspiracy theorist Naomi Wolf, doesn’t pull any punches and that’s absolutely the right approach. The time for gentle remedies and the equivalent of soothing lullabies about how everything will be alright in the end is long past. It was long past six years ago, when Klein wrote the book, and it’s even more long past now. The nature of the catastrophe is us.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In more personal and less doom-laden news, I had another epiphany this week – I think it’s the time of year for them – in which I realised that I spend far too much of my time focusing on tools and apps and things and stuff rather than looking after my own wellbeing. So instead of the usual cavalcade of SMARTER goals I’ve decided to keep my attention on just two things: meditation, and re-establishing my practice; and morning pages, the three page long brain dump which clears my head of so much when I do it every day.

I wish that I could tell you that I have somehow had a lot on, but in fact, the opposite is true: I've had so little on apart from the grinding dullness of lockdown that I haven't found much to write about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week, almost exactly a year to the day of my getting COVID-19, I booked an appointment to get vaccinated against it. There's a neat symmetry to this. But more importantly what a feat of technology and science going from zero to multiple vaccines in a short period of time is. It's not likely COVID-19 will ever become an eradicable disease in the way smallpox is, but it will be a controllable one that isn't going to overwhelm health services and decimate the population, anywhere. That's something to celebrate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This morning was also a reminder that I've been writing a personal diary more or less daily for over 11 years. This is something that the iPad changed for me. Before its release in 2010 I was an intermittent journaler, writing occasionally in Word or Google Docs to a lesser or greater degree, and very much off and on. After the iPad was released, and once the wonderful Day One app appeared, I started writing much more. There's something about the form factor of the iPad, even then, which encouraged the daily habit of writing for me. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Writing privately is always cathartic but what makes tools like Day One more valuable is their ability to surface what you were writing, how you were feeling and where you were over time. You start to see the repetitions and rhythms of your thoughts and your life and that is what allows you to grow and develop. When you see the same themes cropping up, year after year, you start to understand the habits and considerations that have become ingrained in you, filtering out (or at least better understanding) the shorter term worries and joys.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It also lets you see the periods of your life which became dominated by the events of family and friends around you and see how for a period of time they came to define a large part of who you were. For me, and for Kim, a large part of the last ten years was defined by caring for her mother and father and for my mother. My forties were defined by caring, death and grief. So strange to think that a decade of your life can vanish like that. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The pile of books that I want to read expands with every issue of the <em>London Review of Books</em> which arrives. Reading more is the yin to the yang of writing more:when I don't do one, I don't tend to do the other either. Whenever I reacquaint myself with one the other quickly follows. Of the many parallel lives that someone shaped like me is living in the multiverse, I sometimes wonder if the most content of all Ians is the one who reads and writes the most. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the garden, one of our jackdaws -- dubbed the CORVID-19 because there's so many of them -- has discovered that if he perches <em>just so</em> on a particular part of the bird feeder, he can happily peck at the one containing the fat balls with their delicious crop of worms and seeds. And, of course, he's also worked out that pecking at bottom one will ultimately lead to all the other fat balls dropping down: like a bottomless soft drink at the restaurant, this is the gift that never stops giving. Meanwhile the blue tits, sparrows, long tail tits, robins and occasional woodpecker also come to feed, and are looking fat this year already. I suspect a crop of chicks will be getting well fed soon. The rabbits who feed on the lawn continue to mostly ignore me, and the healthy country foxes continue to patrol every now and then, making the rabbits scatter. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Our cat, George, continues to be old. At nearly 19 and with virtually every organ having a slightly different level of wonkiness, her hunting days are over and she has taken to sleeping in my armpit. She will even happily let me cover her with a blanket, which would have been anathema not that long ago. Old cats are often anxious -- every fibre of their instincts are telling them they are likely to be eaten soon -- and so they often tend to seek the company of their owners.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite Microsoft pricing the device to fail in the UK I've somehow ended up buying a Surface Duo. Yes, the cost here is <em>ridiculous</em> – £1300 at a time when the price has been reduced to $999 in the US – but I've always loved Microsoft's Surface line and was curious about it. And I'm in the incredibly fortunate position of being able to support curiosity purchases. Not spending £700 on commuting tends to do that. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some quick thoughts:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft is on to something when it talks about the productivity of dual screens, and I think it's correct that dual screens are better than a single large foldable screen for this purpose. I'd <em>really</em> like to see this in a larger format as a tablet, which was obviously the intention behind the now-canned Surface Neo. Even though it's a lot smaller, I prefer having two screens versus a single one which splits virtually. I can't quite explain why, but it feels much more natural.</li>\n<li>Apps which span are few and far between -- basically Microsoft's own and a hand full of others. However, I've actually found myself almost never using it in this mode, even with Microsoft apps. It works nicely, and the apps are -- in my experience -- now pretty rock solid but I just don't use it. Much more often I'm using a pair of apps to do something, such as Outlook on one side and To Do on the other, dragging and dropping neatly between the two.</li>\n<li>The hardware really is beautifully designed, and you can see that the team who created it have poured their heart and soul into it. The hinge on its own is a thing of joy: incredibly smooth, just the right resistance, and firm enough to hold in place without accidentally getting knocked into another position. Well done, Microsoft.</li>\n<li>When I say it is beautifully designed, I mean that it pases my \"pick up\" test: this is a device that you constantly want to pick up and use. </li>\n<li>Lack of 5G, NFC and so on do not feel like limitations at this point. Likewise, the camera: it's good enough for the things it is designed to so (video calling, quick captures of documents and whiteboards). No one is going to use this as their main camera. </li>\n<li>Software performance is fine. Microsoft seems to have got the bugs out, and it never feels slow, which probably goes to prove that if you take out the need for lots of performance for image processing and AI, you really don't need to have the latest generation of chip.</li>\n<li>The one area that Microsoft needs to work on more is typing, as the experience of the on-screen keyboard is hit and miss. It's perfectly fine when you are thumb typing with it folded over, and when you have a split screen and are holding it like a little laptop, thumb typing away. However, when it tries to shift the keyboard over to the side a little so you can type one-handed, it doesn't <em>quite</em> shift over enough if you have small hands. Most of the time I find myself holding it with one hand and swiping with the other instead - and that is fine. </li>\n</ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Overall I think Microsoft is on to something with this form factor, but I <em>really</em> wish it was larger and a tablet rather than smaller and a sort-of phone. Microsoft is absolutely  correct not to market this as a smartphone, because it never really feels like one -- but it does feel like a tiny, interesting and highly usable mini-tablet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Likewise, it makes getting words into Ulysses incredibly easy. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Not everyone wants to see every piece of source code behind an interface, but everyone <strong>should</strong> be able to write without worrying that the underlying format will mean no ability to read those words in the future. As a kind of lingua franca for structured words, Markdown is great, but not everyone wants to see <code>[links looking like this](http://daringfireball.net)</code> when they are writing. For some people – like me – it’s distracting and a little irritating to see everything. If anything, I would like an option in Ulysses to just hide <strong>all</strong> the formatting stuff. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For me, Ulysses offers just the right balance: a really good editor, using Markdown so I know I can always read those words no matter what platform I am using in the future, and an excellent client on both Mac and iPad.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I always have a temptation with these notes to begin them with “this week, I have mostly been eating elderberries” which will make absolutely no sense to anyone younger than about 40. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve been reflective this week. Is there any other way to be when you’re more or less confined to the house? And what I’ve been reflecting on is balance, and how out of kilter things have become. Because I’ve lacked energy, all my energy has been going into work, and not enough into other parts of my life. Because of lockdown, the other areas of my life have also had other kinds of neglect: there’s no visiting friends, the opportunities to get out and do things are limited, and like everyone I feel like my horizons have shrunk. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Things will change, though. This week was the first week of <a href=\"https://thefocuscourse.com\">The Focus Course</a>, which is created and curated by <a href=\"https://shawnblanc.net\">Shawn Blanc</a> and seems pretty-much designed to start the process of lifting your eyes and focusing on the horizon. This week was all about examining the roles in your life and working out what your values are. Although you make a big long list of them, you’re asked to boil it down to the two which are really import and which are consistent across all the roles, interests and responsibilities you have. Mine came down to two: self-improvement (I am very definitely a life-long learner at heart) and service. I wasn’t expecting that, but as soon as I wrote it down I realised how much of my love of life comes when I’m doing something which contributes to the well-being of others, whether that is on the small scale of friends and family or the wider view of the environment and society. And the two values are tightly linked: the more capable I make myself, the more I look after myself, the better I can contribute. And the more I contribute, the more I learn and improve. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps because I’ve been going through this kind of self-reflective exercise I’ve also found myself getting into my flow a few times. Flow is often talked about like a semi-mystical thing among the kind of people who buy every single productive book ever written, but all it boils down to is clarity about what you want to do in the moment. Once you have that clarity, you have to actively resist to stop yourself doing something: distractions melt. Lots of tools can help you make the most of that clarity when you reach it, but there are no tools which can help you get there is the first place. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I also found some time to play some <a href=\"https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/home\">Elder Scrolls Online</a>. I’m fascinated by tit as a game and an experience: the depth and breadth of story is like nothing else I’ve ever played, and it manages to tread the line between being a good and highly playable game for soloing and a group experience. It’s a shame that the Mac client is a piece of crap, but there’s a reason why I always have a decent PC in the house. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unconnected — I hope — but I don’t feel like I’m getting enough sleep at the moment. Although I’ve long thought that much of my sleepiness is related to long COVID-19, I think it’s more likely to be a combination of things: not enough fresh air and irregular bed times being the main culprit. Nothing that I can’t fix. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Related: if you have an Apple Watch, it’s worth trying out the “<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/01/time-to-walk-an-inspiring-audio-walking-experience-comes-to-apple-fitness-plus/\">Time To Walk</a>” series. These are combined podcasts and walking workout with an interesting person talking to you as if you were just going on a walk together. It’s a surprisingly nice idea and really well executed: I had no idea who Shawn Mendes was, but he was an interesting walking companion. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two things appeared from the online shopping fairies this week. The first was a penknife. Yes, a Swiss Army penknife, something that I haven’t owned for about thirty years. The<a href=\"https://www.victorinox.com/uk/en/Products/Swiss-Army-Knives/Medium-Pocket-Knives/Super-Tinker/p/1.4703\"> Victorinox Super Tinker</a>, which they describe as “the ideal companion for all crafty men and women”. Mostly I bought it because I’m fed up with never being able to find a small pair of scissors, but it’s also a nod towards the post-lockdown world and how much I want to travel and camp and do outdoorsy things in the middle of nowhere. It can sit in my <a href=\"https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr2\">Goruck</a>, ready for the next phase of the world. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other thing that arrived was a <a href=\"https://paperlike.com\">Paperlike</a> screen protector for my iPad Pro. This is another example of something which occasionally happens to me, where I buy something, and it offers such a better experience that I have to do some kind of upgrade for other devices. For example, after buying the <a href=\"https://getfreewrite.com\">Freewrite</a> I had to get <a href=\"https://www.daskeyboard.com/daskeyboard-4-professional-for-mac/\">a proper mechanical keyboard</a> for my Mac mini, as it basically ruined my relationship with every other keyboard I had. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In this case, using the <a href=\"https://remarkable.com\">Remarkable 2 </a>tablet with its exceptional writing feel utterly destroyed the experience of writing and drawing on the iPad Pro. To get it to the point where I could use the iPad Pro again, I needed to get a Paperlike which gives a much better writing surface: not as good as the Remarkable, but good enough to stop me from never wanting to use the Apple Pencil again. It also has the advantage of giving the screen a nice matte look which takes away some brightness but massively increases the readability in sunlight and just makes the whole thing more pleasant. Again, not as good as the Remarkable, but a big improvement. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have written a draft of a longer article about the Remarkable 2 which I’ll edit and post later in the week. The short version: I like it, but if you’re buying one you have to be clear about where it fits in your life and what it’s replacing/augmenting. The use for it is more fuzzy than something like the Freewrite, where it’s obvious where it drops into your workflow and so you can either use it (if you write everything as an initial draft) or not get one (if you write differently). That makes it harder to recommend unreservedly because there are several ways you could use it, some of this are stronger than others. But as a piece of industrial design, it’s an absolutely lovely piece of work. If Apple can ever get the iPad this thin and light, the rest of the industry should just give up making tablets and go home. If they haven’t already. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I realised a few days ago that, apart from taking out the bins and refilling bird feeders, I hadn’t left the house for at least a week. Possibly longer. This is an era of strange hibernation, when I am constantly in contact with people every single day and yet see very little of the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s a shame (and it’s something I immediately started to fix) as this is also one of my favourite times of year. Every time that I feel the January cold on my face I remember being 17 and walking the three miles from my girlfriend’s house to home, late at night and freezing cold. Like the weather in Autumn – still my favourite season – winter is a time when I feel like anything in possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But not so much this year. If there was a word to describe January 2021 it is “waiting”. Everyone is waiting for something: waiting for their turn to get a vaccine, waiting for the shit to hit the fan about Brexit, waiting for signs that our government might be going the same way as that of Donald Trump. We’re all waiting for something, like the moment when the pub is closing and you’re waiting on the corner outside to work out where you go next.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, Kent is its usual self, a place that’s both conservative and radical. It’s also one of the places that is likely to feel the worst effects of Brexit, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/jan/20/furious-kent-residents-step-up-fight-over-brexit-lorry-park\">parts turned into lorry parks</a> and <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/brexit/brexit-food-prices-rise-increase-inequality-uk-experts-816886\">food prices on the rise</a>. These are the kinds of things which disproportionately affect the poorest, and Kent has more than its fair share of poverty.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week also saw the arrival of my Remarkable 2 tablet. For those who have managed to avoid the company’s endless adverts on Instagram (or is that just me?) it’s a thin, light tablet designed to be written on which has an incredibly readable e-ink screen. I finally succumbed to buying one after reading <a href=\"https://revdancatt.com/journal/2021/01/10/remarkable-2-one-week-update\">Rev Dan Catt’s review</a> and then finding that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RellyAB/status/1351196383139799045?s=20\">Relly had bought one too</a>. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My original thought was that I’d mostly want to use it as an e-reader, as a lot of my books are DRM-free ePubs which don’t really work particularly well with a Kindle. Actually, I think I’ll get a lot more use of it from the task it’s best at: writing notes. It is <strong>really</strong> nice to write on, much better than an iPad. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So given that I have a 12.9in iPad Pro, why did I buy this? Mostly it’s the same reason that I bought a Freewrite: I like devices which offer a distraction-free environment for doing one particular thing. Just as the Freewrite is really good at just hammering out a draft, so the Remarkable is just focused on taking notes. If I brainstorm and take notes on my iPad, even with Do Not Disturb on, there’s the siren call of doing something else. I could <em>just</em> check Twitter, or I could <em>just</em> check what’s happening in the news, or I could <em>just</em> watch one video on YouTube. On the Remarkable, I can’t do any of those things – and that’s a really useful brake on my level of distraction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like Dan, I do my best thinking by just scribbling something down in a notebook. That gets turned into something else, and copying notes by hand into the best format to take them further is a valuable part of the process – essential if I want to really understand whatever it is I’m working on. Adding the little bit of friction involved in moving from a single-purpose device like the Remarkable or Freewrite improves the work and makes it more considered. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week I also realised quite how much I’m <em>aching</em> to travel again. Mythical places like Manchester, Oxford and Bristol, which I’m now convinced only exist in my imagination. I have a <a href=\"https://www.goruck.com/collections/gr1/products/gr1-midnight-navy\">new rucksack</a> that’s sitting, ready to be packed. I’d even accept a train trip into London as a valid piece of travel, rather than one of the world’s most dull commutes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like half the people I  know I watched the first episode of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Sin_(TV_series)\">It’s a Sin</a></em>. Unlike everyone else, I’ve only watched the first episode, and I don’t know if I will watch any more. It’s clearly brilliant, but I am just not sure that I need to be taken back to that era, which is a time that I have enormously mixed feelings about. You should watch it, because it really is good, but it causes me too much pain.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week we also watched <em>Joker</em> for the first time, and my feelings towards it were exactly as I expected (and why I had avoided it for so long): I didn’t like it. All I could hear in the back of my head was a chorus of emotionally under-developed men’s rights activists cheering that here was a character who was fucked up by women and took revenge against society. Against the background of where politics and society are right now, I don’t think that the movie’s joke really lands. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A couple of weeks ago <a href=\"https://www.gyford.com/phil/writing/2021/01/17/weeknotes/\">Phil wrote</a> that “I’m quite tired and feel like I’m plodding on through identical days until some unknown time when maybe things will be OK again.”</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think everyone is feeling that way right now.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is the last week note I’ll write this year. So, how did 2020 feel to me? I’m struck by the similarities to space travel. We have endured stretches of boredom, unable to move from the safe havens of our homes. But underneath the ennui and routine of occupying our little ships there has been a constant level of background anxiety, as our limbic systems dealt with the uncertain future by levelling up our cortisol, cranking the alertness until we are left constantly fuzzy and tired. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have all lived on the edge. For me, this year has been yet another one that has been a holding pattern. Since my father got sick and died in the latter half of the '00s, for one reason or another our lives have been on hold. And now, a global event that has forced all of us into shelter, put a stop to movement both physically and mentally.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course that’s not the only major even of the year which has dripped anxiety into our lives. For anyone who understands its potential impact Brexit has been a constant source of concern, and — until the moment it became obvious he had lost — the prospect of another four years of Trump putting American democracy to the sword didn’t help. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And yet… you would have to be extremely unaware of yourself for this year not to have forced you into some reflection about yourself and what you find important. Times like these change everyone in ways that are unpredictable, but they also coerce you into a better appreciation of what is important what, possibly, you have taken for granted. For me, it’s the ability to travel, both within the UK and overseas, and once we’ve all been saved by science I intend to spend a great deal of time on the road.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Roam</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve been trying out <a href=\"http://www.roamrsearch.com\">Roam Research</a>, currently the hottest note-taking application among the kind of people who like “personal information management” as a topic. It combines three concepts in a simple way to good effect: Daily notes; two-way linking between notes; and the ability to reuse blocks of writing anywhere in other notes. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What do I think of it? The temptation with a tool like this is to try and do too much too quickly. You could try and create the perfect Zettelkasten note-taking system, and try and impose too much structure, but I think the best approach is probably the most simple: Just write daily notes, creating pages for projects and topics as you go along. If nothing comes of those projects or topics, no harm done. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s definitely useful for putting together Weeknotes. All I have to do is write snippets during my daily notes, then pull them together with block embeds at the end of the week. No additional writing required. Of course, the only down side to this is I need to write my notes as if they were going to be published, or sharpen them up later (embedding is two-way: if I amend a block in the weeknote, it’s changed in the daily notes too).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Chore of the week: </strong>we finally swapped the old Prestcold fridge from the kitchen for a newer one which had been in Kim’s old flat years ago. This means we’ve exchanged a 60-year-old fridge, which was still working but tended to get iced up, for one that’s a mere 20 years old. Domestic appliances, eh? They really don’t build them like they used to.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The excellent <strong>BookTrack</strong> app tells me that I have read 23 books this year. I’m not 100% sure that’s correct — I definitely don’t feel like I’ve read that many books — but I’ve definitely been reading much more than I used to. That’s been one positive of 2020: there’s been so much more time available to read.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I suspect that the Venn diagram of people who own both an M1 Mac and a Surface Pro X is small. I fall into that section in the middle, so I thought it was worth summarizing how the two compare.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I should say from the start that the Surface Pro X is by far and away my favourite Windows device. I also have a Surface Book 3, which is a pretty powerful laptop in its own right, but which I just don’t love as much.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The hardware design of the Surface Pro X is exceptional, and it is one of the few non-Apple devices that I’ve owned which matches Apple’s level of industrial design. Using an ARM processor with its much less hefty thermal requirements than Intel chips has freed Microsoft’s hardware designers to make the Surface that they have clearly always had in their heads. It’s thin and light, with an exceptionally lovely screen, and in my experience it just never gets hot, something that I can’t say of any Intel-based computer I’ve ever used.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For some categories of user, myself included, the performance is actually good. Performance is a relative thing: what’s acceptable for someone who lives in the browser would be glacial for a designer who spends their life in Photoshop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My work life is solidly in Office 365 and a browser, and for this kind of work–which we should remember is a huge chunk of users across the globe—the Surface Pro X is perfect. Office and Edge have never felt slow, no matter how many tabs or documents I have open. And the ability to use it anywhere thanks to built-in LTE makes it more useful than a conventional laptop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>My M1 Mac mini is… well, it’s a Mac. It does everything I have ever used my Macs for, including audio and video editing, and subjectively does it as well and as fast as anything I’ve ever used. It feels faster than my year old 16in MacBook Pro, which has double the memory and on paper at least ought to be easily quicker. And it does it while being silent, cool and snappy with everything.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Using it with third party hardware has also been a very Mac-like experience. Whatever third party hardware I have plugged in has worked from an old Logitech webcam to a Blue Yeti USB mic. Even the software which allows me to programme my Corsair gaming mouse works perfectly. I don’t even know if it’s running ARM or Intel code.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s the crucial difference between the two devices. You don’t have to think about the Mac mini as anything other than a Mac. With the Surface Pro X you need to remember that it’s not a Windows device, it’s an ARM Windows device, and limit what you can do accordingly. If your requirements sit within those limitations, it’s a great machine. If they don’t, you won’t be able to use it at all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is why Microsoft’s marketing language about Windows on ARM devices focuses on how they are “a new category of PC” and why it talks about the Surface Pro X as for “mobile professionals”. The company isn’t confident—rightly—that ARM devices can replace an Intel PC except in those specific circumstances. Apple thinks of the M1 as making the Mac just a better Mac, first for low-end customers where it can deliver performance that’s already close to the top end, and in 2021 and 2022 for its most demanding users.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What can Microsoft do? I honestly don’t think there’s much it can, at the moment. To get to where Apple is, Microsoft needs to persuade Qualcomm that it should devote time and effort to build chips optimised for higher thermal envelope devices, such as laptops and desktops. That’s not as easy as it sounds. It also needs to persuade Qualcomm that building in features to make it easier to emulate or translate Intel code is worth the effort.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the software side, it also needs to sort out the mess that is Windows development. Windows Presentation Foundation, Universal Windows Platform, Progressive Web Apps… the entire system is a mess that makes it harder, not easier, to choose how to develop for Windows. This is something that Apple has been very good at managing in the past.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Can Intel or AMD keep up? Apple is already a larger processor company than either of them in terms of units shipped, thanks to its wholly owned designs for the A- and no M-series. Combine iPhone and iPad and Apple ships more than 250m devices per year. Most of those devices will share a great deal in terms of processor design as the M1, meaning that the Mac gains from the economy of scale and design cost amortisation that Intel can only dream of. There are of course big differences between an M1 and an A14, but they share the same cores, the same Neural Engine, the same image processing and secure enclave designs. Perhaps over time the high performance cores in iPhone and Mac will diverge, but at the moment Apple doesn’t need to do it, so it can benefit from being able to design one processor core which ships in 250m devices a year—more than the number of PCs shipping over the same time scale.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think all this adds up to Microsoft and Intel being in a bigger boatload of trouble than most people think. The shift to ARM feels like a classic Clay Christiansen transformational technology moment, with M1 the tipping point when a technology moves from cheaper but not as powerful as the incumbent to beating it. The path that Microsoft and Intel must take is a radical rethinking of their own businesses, and I am not clear that the internal forces in either company have accepted that yet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes weeks drift by with only one or two things to write about, and because those things often involve super-commercially-confidential work-stuff I can't always write about them at all. This has not been one of those weeks.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On Tuesday, I co-wrote an <a href=\"https://www.ppa.co.uk/article/adam-banks\">obituary piece about Adam for the PPA</a>, which my old colleagues at Dennis Publishing had kindly thought of me to write (and a massive thank you to James Tye and Tim Danton for this). </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I realised after writing this that it wasn't the first time I have had to write a tribute for a friend who has passed away. A few years ago, Adam asked me to do the same for Paul Nesbitt, MacUser columnist and one of the formative influences on my writing career. Paul was both a brilliant reporter and -- in his guise as Paul Hofner -- a fantastic musician too. Another of the MacUser polymaths. Doing the annual MacUser columnists' lunch with Paul, Tony Tyler and Charles Shaar Murray was both an exercise is extreme drunkenness and a huge privilege. The stories that Tony, in particular, would tell about the music business that he had been a close part of for many years while working on the NME were mainly libellous and definitely unprintable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There's been a bunch of work stuff too. Completing the first draft of a document to help print teams create better digital content; some work on a Big International Project; some social media auditing. Most importantly, working on the essay for the next module of my M.Sc. coursework, which is all about change management. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The spooky thing about this course has been how the modules have magically mapped on to real world events. We looked at business resilience just as COVID-19 hit, which unsurprisingly meant our assignments were all about looking at our response to COVID-19. This, I will state publicly, was actually incredibly impressive. In particular, the IT teams ability to get a lot of previously desk-bound workers set up to work from home within days was amazing. I'm sure a lot of IT teams did the same, but ours did a brilliant job. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Two things on the personal side. I've picked up my meditation practice again: although I have been meditating regularly for a good couple of years it had slipped from daily to a couple of times a week. So, I'm back to daily, as I really feel the need (and feel the difference it makes to my stress levels). Taking a hint from <a href=\"https://mattdavella.com\">Matt D'Avella</a>, I'm adding a degree of semi-public accountability by having the chart where I mark off the days in the kitchen, rather than just in my notebook. Yes, only Kim can see it: but having that degree of just-enough public notice is important. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have also picked up my <a href=\"https://bulletjournal.com\">Bullet Journaling</a> practice again. My current notebook is the fifth that I've used as a Bullet Journal, but over the past few months I had drifted away from it. As I was spending more time in front of screens than ever, thanks to working from home, I had got it in my head that an all-electronic system would be better.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That meant plenty of faffing with different task managers, note taking apps, and so on — until I ended up just realising that for 90% of my purposes, handwritten is just better. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One other thing from this week: I wrote about 750 words about my experience of <a href=\"https://www.rcot.co.uk/how-manage-post-viral-fatigue-after-covid-19-0\">post-COVID fatigue</a>. Since I got the dreaded bug back in March I've struggled with a level of tiredness (particularly in the afternoons) that I've never experienced before. I'm also struggling with whether to write about it or not, at least publicly. It feels like whining -- my symptoms are so minor compared to people who got it bad and still really suffer. It affects my work and life but in ways that can be worked around and managed. Perhaps I'll publish it, though. I don't know yet.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

He had more influence, though, over the course that magazine was to take and more widely too: it’s fair to say that Banksy did more to move the design of technology magazines out of the dark ages of a PC on every cover than anyone else. But the design work he fostered pushed forward not just tech but all magazines, something that’s almost lost to memory today.

I don’t think I was good at it, but even under me the impetus was strong enough for us to win a PPA Cover of the Year.

The time that our big boss Felix Dennis rang up the office to complain about a particularly abstract cover, while Adam was in San Francisco for a Macworld show, for example.

We wore the phrase that Felix had used to describe the cover — “Art Wank Shit” — with pride, and of course Adam laughed as much as the rest of us.

I spend a lot of my time managing people, and intrinsically that's not something that I can often write about publicly. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This week though, I've had the pleasure of interviewing a bunch of young people who have applied to work on some paid internships we're running, and it's been incredibly rewarding. It's part of the government's <em>Kickstarter</em> programme, which is designed to help employed people to get work experience and training to give them a foot in the door towards a permanent job. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Doing ten interviews in two days is always hard work, but what's been brilliant is just how fantastic and smart and engaged the people have been. None of them have been over 21, some have been graduates and some not, but all of them have been great. What's also heartening -- and I think important -- is that all of them have honed in on the fact that we do a lot of campaigning and support for mental health in the workplace, and that diversity is an enormous and important issue for us. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think companies need to think about this: these are issues that are important to young people in particular when choosing an employer, and if you're not focused on them, you could lose out on talent. There's a demographic time bomb coming down the line, as the lower rates of birth impact on the number of young people entering the workforce (exacerbated by Brexit), which means that companies will need to compete for new employees in a way they haven't had to do since the era of full employment in the 1960s.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But most important of all: the kids are alright. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile, of course my new M1-powered Mac mini arrived. I've written about why I got it a bit, and I'm not going to do anything like benchmarking (the world does not need another M1 benchmark) but I'll write more about my experience this week. So far... well, it's a Mac. It is incredibly snappy, and with one exception, every Intel-code app I've run has worked well. In fact, what code the app is running is basically invisible to you: after the first time you run Rosetta, when it asks you if you want to install it, it's hard to even se what kind of code you're running (you have to go and look in the Info for each app, checking if it says \"Universal\" or not).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The exception, sadly, is Elder Scrolls Online, which has been my favourite MMORPG since I stopped regularly playing World of Warcraft a few years ago. ESO is great if you love a huge, sprawling world with enough story to keep you interested for years, a lot of variety in play styles (any character class can fill any role) and a really nicely developed world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Unfortunately, its developers have also said they have no plans to support the M1 Macs, which basically means that over the long term they are throwing in the towel on Mac development -- in two years, all Macs will be M1. Not only that, they won't support it running under emulation, which is a shame as other games which run under emulation seem to run, and run well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I guess they won't be the only ones: some developers, particularly in AAA games, could use this as a chance to stop supporting the Mac. And that would be a shame because ultimately, I don't have much doubt that the graphical and game play capabilities of this new generation of Mac will be exceptional. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So... I think it might be time to go back to WoW. Anyone got a friendly guild?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I lasted a day without preordering a new Mac running Apple’s M1 processor. That’s an improvement, right? Better than I would have done a few years ago?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Well… not by much. My chronic case of former tech journalist disease means that, even though I don’t need to keep abreast of the latest technology for work, whenever a new and interesting change in computers comes out, I end up having to buy it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That’s how come I own a Surface Pro X, and it’s now why I own a Mac mini with Apple’s M1 ARM-based processor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I bought the lowest-end model, with 8Gb of memory and 256Gb storage. Having paid out #1800 for a new 16in MacBook Pro earlier in the year, I didn’t really want to pay another #1000 plus for a MacBook Air or Pro 13. I also have too many laptops, anyway.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The timing was right, though, for a desktop Mac, the first one I have owned since another Mac mini about 12 years ago. The shift to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic has made me rethink my home working setup, alongside how I work. I have another post in the works about this, but having a fantastic, clear working space has become very important to me, and utilising a small desktop computer with a screen makes a lot more sense than it did even a few months ago.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The relatively limited storage doesn’t worry me. The cloud storage services I use all do on-demand downloading and manage how much of your local storage they take up (this is the future, people).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What about that 8Gb memory, though? Almost everyone’s consensus is that 8Gb is paltry, 16Gb is the bare minimum for proper work, and anyone serious has 32Gb.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think this misunderstands the advantages of moving memory from discreet components to part of the system on a chip (SoC). Apple’s unified memory architecture is fast and efficient, and swapping between fast, efficient memory and fast SSDs is nothing like paging in and out of RAM from spinning disks back in the day. Remember, too that Apple has a lot of experience in this: while flagship phones in the Android world now come with 12Gb of RAM, the iPhone 12 Pro Max has just 6Gb—and the iPhone 12 gets by with just 4Gb. And now one would say those devices are slow or lacking in power.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sure, the requirements with a Mac aren’t the same as a phone, but neither does the Mac have the same design restraints.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The new Mac arrives tomorrow, and I’ll be setting it up tomorrow night, so I’ll know more then.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve been doing a lot of thinking over the course of the last week, some of which manifested itself as a post about <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2020/11/14/a-letter-to-my-23-year-old-self/\">a letter to my 23-year-old self</a> which I published yesterday. A lot of the thinking has been about art, and writing, and how I’ve allowed the practice of my writing to lapse a little. Some of it was about the tools that I use, and considered what the right things are to inspire me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve been reading a book called <em><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/japonisme/erin-niimi-longhurst/9780008286040\">Japonisme</a></em> by Erin Niimi Longhurst over the past couple of weeks. It’s a book about Japanese culture and her relationship to it. Some of it is just about the cultural practices themselves, some about the attitudes which spawn them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing apparent throughout is the Japanese understanding of the importance of tools, of choosing the right one for the job and of caring for them in the right way.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have always unknowingly shared the late 20th Century Western attitude towards tools: disposability. And I’ve coupled this to the technologist’s approach to physical tools: there is always a better one coming out next year.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So much of how we approach technology is formed by the knowledge that whatever you use is outdated almost at the point you acquire it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because computers are so malleable they also invite constant change in <em>how</em> we work, too. The almost infinite flexibility that software provides means that we can change the process by which we create things almost at will. It also means there’s a temptation to fiddle with the way we create.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2020/11/13/writing-with-the-freewrite/\">a review earlier this week of the Freewrite</a> and I mentioned that the device is opinionated. Its lack of flexibility forces you into a particular way of working with words: first thinking, then drafting, then editing, with the role of the Freewrite sitting solely in the middle. You can’t edit on it, which means you have to adopt that draft to edit process. It forces you to codify the idea into a draft, <em>then</em> to use another tool to pare it back into something worth saying.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Compress fossilised trees for long enough, and you get coal. Compress coal for long enough, and you get diamonds. So much of what we write never gets beyond being coal: valuable, but not valuable enough.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first couple of days of this week also saw me reestablish my practice of going for a walk in the morning before settling down to work. This is a very different lockdown to the last one. Last time there were almost no cars on the road. The parade of four-by fours taking children to the private school at the top of the road is back with a vengeance, leading to increased air pollution which, I have no doubt, leaves those middle-class parents wondering why their child has asthma. The cognitive dissonance which those kinds of parents manage to have never ceases to amaze me.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On Tuesday, I had the realisation that I'm 17 years away from retiring. That is exactly the distance between now and when I left <em>MacUser</em> magazine in 2003, and that feels like about five minutes ago. We live our lives on a logarithmic scale, inching forward like tortoises when we’re young and gradually learning to walk, then run, then sprint, until your later years start to pass by at an alarming pace.

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dear Ian,</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Congratulations on leaving Hatfield and getting a pretty good degree! I’d like to say that you worked hard for it, and you certainly put the effort in over that last semester. You’re a bright lad and you have come a long way. You didn’t have many expectations of yourself when you started this journey but I hope you have come to realise that you’re cleverer than you thought you were.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Thirty years later, I think that I’ve learned quite a bit more about life. I know you’re not good at taking advice, but I thought that I would put this letter in a time bottle and throw it overboard. Perhaps by some kind of temporal miracle it will reach you and change how you think about a few things. But I guess that I know already that it didn’t. Unless that many worlds interpretation of quantum theory is correct, in which case this is another future you who never existed typing this, and there’s a different future me trying to whisper to another me in not-his past.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This whole time stuff is confusing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyway, this is as much about me as it is you which means I’ll write it anyway. That’s the first lesson by the way: it’s never always about you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When we look back at our past selves it’s easy to become either condemnatory or nostalgic. What a prat I was. Or on the other hand how full of youthful energy, how lacking in fear!</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like most views of the past, no one can never really know which is more true, but I suspect that actually neither is all that accurate. So, I’m not going to judge you and find you wanting, or lionise you and wish I <em>was</em> you, again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Instead, I’m going to write about a few things that I’ve learned more about since I was you, and hope you can consider them. Feel free to reject them — I probably would, and I was you once — but also think about them often.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first thing I would say is to care less about what people think and more about what people feel. When I was you, I was obsessed with reason and thinking. I was very much a rationalist, even though I thought of myself as a renaissance man. Spending your time obsessing about what people think about you is less important than making them feel good about themselves. People are always more insecure than that look. You can capitalise on that, but to be honest that makes you a bit of a bastard. Lift people up. Make them feel like they are the most important person in the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember too that love is something that requires nurturing, and expect it to change. You don’t love people in the same way all the time. Love ages, and like all things that age that can either mean it withers and dies or it becomes deeper and more seasoned. But it never stays the same, and harking back to how a love was is to choke it with the thorns of your memories.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Take some risks. You have time on your side here, but no matter what age you are you can always shake things up a little. Don’t do it for the sake of it, but remember that life is change: the more you hold on to it the more quickly it will slip away from you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Grasp opportunities — but only if they are something you want to do. Just because someone else presents with you with a chance to do something doesn’t mean you have to take that chance. Of course, that depends on you knowing what you want…</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To understand what you want, you need to be more reflective. I know it feels like navel-gazing, but without understanding what you want you can never have it. It’s only recently that I’ve understood that failing to think about what you want is really all about being afraid: afraid that if you find what you want, you might not be able to have it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Academic philosophy is not for you. You’ll find this out of your own accord, of course, and it all turns out absolutely fine. But I think you probably know this already.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember that friends are not hot-swappable. Moving away doesn’t have to mean moving on. It will take you a long time to realise how much you miss people but you’ll get there in the end. Getting to it earlier will save you a bit of anguish.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Do more art! Don’t be afraid to call yourself an artist. You can write and you’re a good communicator, but keep practicing. Art is a practice, but that means you have to keep flexing those muscles. Put the words out daily, and never be afraid to show your work in progress.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You’re a good lad, and you are still such a <em>lad</em> in so many ways. Not a boy, not really yet a man, but very definitely a lad.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I would say all the best at this point, but I know that you don’t get all the best. No one does. But I still wish it for you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, all the best,</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>You + 30.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For anyone that has spent the last 20 years or so typing on ever less satisfying keyboards, writing with the <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-last-good-man-9781526609243/\">Astrohaus Freewrite</a> is a strange experience. In fact, in some ways it is profoundly disconcerting. Going back to a normal computer keyboard and regular large screen is like emerging from a wilderness retreat.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like a wilderness retreat, the Freewrite is an attempt to regain some simplicity and with it that often talked of but little understood condition of <em>flow</em>. Flow has attained almost mystical status in the productivity and artistic communities as a kind of meditative state in which, thanks to an extreme of focus, the words just come. In an age when your phone goes ping and there’s an incoming message request every few seconds from one or more demanding social networks, flow is power.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, how does this relate to the chunky little box on which I’m typing this draft? It helps at this point to describe what the Freewrite is and what it’s intended to do. Launched in 2017 by a small company called Astrohaus, Freewrite is a combination of excellent mechanical keyboard and e-ink screen, all in a box which looks like a steampunk typewriter. You type, words appear on screen. That, in a nutshell is what Freewrite is and does.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Compared to any computer you’re likely to use daily the Freewrite is an absolute <em>chonk</em>. It weighs around four pounds and the case is made from some kind of metal — probably aluminium but whatever it is it’s substantial. The base is plastic with a slightly grippy feel, which obviously ensures it firmly stays even on your expensive executive glass meeting room table, Mr Hipster Executive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everything about this machine is designed to look and feel analogue. The switches which allow you to change which folder you’re writing in and turn Wi-Fi on and off are big, mechanical beasts rather than wimpy little buttons. The power switch is a red button with a satisfying push to it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then, of course, there is the keyboard. It’s mechanical and uses Cherry MX Brown switches. For those relatively new to technical switches, the Brown switch is often favoured as it has a relatively short depth of travel before the key is activated, but then an extended depression which gives it a satisfying thunk if you bottom it out. In other words, you can go relatively gently on it and be about as quiet as a mechanical keyboard can get, or you can hammer it a little harder and thunk to your heart’s content. Because the activation depth is relatively short, if you are coming from a normal computer keyboard it will not feel like you have to do insane finger workouts before you can actually type anything at speed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just as importantly, like all quality keyboards (and like no laptop keyboards) this is raked at an angle, which gives your hands a more comfortable position and lets them travel across the board a little faster. Once you get used to it, don’t be surprised if your typing speed goes up, but do be prepared to make many errors in the meantime. If, like me, you have typed millions of words on laptop keyboards and just got used to them, it will take a while to adjust. But it’s worth it in the end. Your hands and your typing speed will thank you. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The screen</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The screen on the Freewrite is a pair of e-ink panels. The top one, which is about the size of a small smartphone, is where your words appear as you type. As you would expect from an e-ink screen it is a little laggy, but not dramatically so. There’s a backlight for typing in dimmer conditions, or you can turn that light off and it’s perfectly readable in almost every light.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second screen just underneath serves as an information panel, giving you useful information like a word count, a timer, or a couple of different kinds of clock. I suspect that for me this will stay on the word count permanently. I don’t often need a timer, and annoyingly the timer isn’t persistent. If the company upgrades the software, I would love to see an information panel which combines word count and timer, which I think would be the most useful option of all.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>A digression</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While I was finishing off that sentence I heard the “bong” of Outlook demanding my attention on my laptop and quickly had to break to answer an email. And I instantly realised that this keyboard is going to spoil my experience of my lovely new MacBook Pro unless I get an external Cherry MX Brown keyboard to go with it. The feeling is that different, and even now I can tell it’s that much better. Which leaves me wondering why I resisted getting into mechanical keyboards for this long?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Software</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In line with the rest of the device the software on the Freewrite is minimal. In fact, there really isn’t anything which anyone raised typing on computers would recognise as software. There are no apps. You just type, and words appear on the screen. That’s it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You have three folders to store files in and you access them not through a fancy touch screen but by moving a mechanical switch. You turn it off and get a screensaver. Turn it on and you are back where you left off in whatever document you’re working on. There’s no spell check, no grammar checker, nothing which could potentially get between you and writing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The philosophical typewriter</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is because, unlike most devices, the Freewrite is opinionated about the way you should work. Computers, particularly modern ones, are built on the principle that the user is always right, at least about the way they want to work. Don’t like this word processor? Fine! Use this other one instead! Like to write and edit as you go along? Word will let you do that all day long, with its squiggly red lines and attention-grabbing autocorrects.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Freewrite does not care about your approach. It is built for one approach and one only: you draft, by writing in an uninterrupted way as possible. Then you use another tool to edit and turn your steam of consciousness and raw words into something polished.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Freewrite has absolutely no aspirations to be a device that you edit on. It lacks every editing capability except for a backspace key to get rid of that typo in the previous word. There are no arrow keys. Although you can page up and page down if you want to look back into your text, there’s no cursor that you can more anywhere backwards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like I said, the Freewrite has an opinion about the way you should write, and if you don’t like that opinion you should go somewhere else.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, the Freewrite does have another trick up its sleeve: it does everything possible to make sure that you can get your words into another tool for editing which suits you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Postbox and sync</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the back of the Freewrite is a USB Type-C port which you can use for charging the device, or for connecting it to a computer and pulling files off it. However, remember that Wi-Fi switch? It’s there to connect you with Postbox, which is Astrohaus’ cloud sync service. When connected to Wi-Fi every thirty seconds or so Freewrite connects to Postbox and syncs the latest version of your document to the cloud. From there, you can sync it to Google Drive or Dropbox, and these synced versions are in Word format. This means you can seamlessly move from drafting with the Freewrite to editing in Word, with all its excellent editing features.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s just one caveat: it’s not really sync as you normally understand it. Although Postbox includes a capable little distraction-free writer called Sprinter, changes you make in Sprinter are <em>not</em> synced back to the Freewrite. In fact, if you open a Freewrite-originated document in Sprinter it moves it to a different folder which the Freewrite can’t even access, and removes it from your device.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is a bit of a shame. It’s not that I want to get into a cycle of drafting then editing on the Mac then back to the Freewrite, but there are times when an idea appears while I’m in front of the Mac and I would like to jot it down quickly there and then and expand it later on the Freewrite. But I can’t — yet. There have been some murmurings that it might be possible in the future to edit and roundtrip documents to and from the Freewrite through Sprinter, but it’s not there yet, and if that feature never comes along at all, I won’t be crying over it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When my friend, colleague and now <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/the-last-good-man-9781526609243/\">published author</a> Thomas McMullan <a href=\"https://www.alphr.com/life-culture/1005135/freewrite-review-a-thought-experiment-for-creative-writers-made-reality/\">reviewed</a> the Freewrite a few years ago, he concluded with this:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is easy to write the Freewrite off as an expensive oddity, angled to nostalgic retirees and well-heeled posers, but it shows that the progress of writing technology doesn’t need to travel in a straight line. With its USB Type-C port and automatic cloud syncing, the Freewrite doesn’t ignore internet connectivity, but instead keeps it under tight control. It shows an alternate path, perhaps into a cul-de-sac, where typing doesn’t happen across 20 tabs.</p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other critics gave the device a lot of stick, arguing it was a bit of a hipster toy, but I think Tom was on to something. There is a lot more to the Freewrite. Or rather: there is a lot <em>less</em> to it. It is devoted to one task and one task alone: hammering out a first rough draft of whatever you’re writing. I wrote the first draft of this review on the Freewrite and the experience of it was excellent. Not the experience of the device: the device just got out of the way. What was delightful was the experience of the writing itself. I don’t think I have actually enjoyed the physicality of writing quite so much for years.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In and hour and a half, I’ve written as little over 1800 words on the Freewrite and I have experienced a sense of flow while I’ve been doing it. That is well worth the money this machine cost. Now you’ll have to excuse me — I’m off to order a decent keyboard for the Mac too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s hard to write anything meaningful at the moment without referring to COVID-19, and the prospect of another national lockdown makes it a subject that’s even harder to avoid. Everything is going to be dominated by this for the next month.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the past week, I’ve done several things it won’t be possible to do for a while: walk around Whitstable and go for a meal out not once but twice. Visit friends, and have friends randomly drop in on us. Some plans we had tentatively made for the next month or so are now shelved. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Stoics had a view of the world which suggested that you should embrace what fate has given you. Nietzsche, later, went further and encouraged you to actively love fate: “amor fati”. That means not just acceptance and acquiescence, but saying “no, I’m glad this has happened. I’ll take it.” Cameron, in <em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em>, comes to this perspective when he accidentally rubbishes his dad’s favourite Ferrari.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you’re talking about a pandemic which has killed nearly 60,000 people in Britain and which — if we didn’t lock down — would be likely to kill another 85,000 people over the winter, that can be very hard. When you have lost loved ones that’s doubly true. It feels cruel and heartless, but as a way of living your life… I can see the attraction. It’s a philosophy which was honed in an era familiar with death in a way which we in the west rarely are. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Writing rediscovered</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Probably the biggest personal thing this week was beginning to read Julia Cameron’s <em>The Artist’s Way</em>. I first picked this up in the mid-90’s, committed to doing morning pages for a while, then allowed it to peter out. I was a little busy being stupid. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This time round, instead of a chore I’ve found it something I am eager to do and to embrace. Writing three pages every morning longhand is a challenge, but it’s a good one: I’ve already rediscovered that I have a turn of phrase which doesn’t have to lapse into cliché. Some of it is going to take a little creativity to do in lockdown, but if you’re looking to rediscover your inner voice, then I really recommend it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Meditation practice</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other thing I’ve rediscovered is the impact that meditation has on me. I’ve been meditating regularly for a couple of years, using the Headspace app, but over the past couple of months I had got out of the habit. I hadn’t stopped — but I wasn’t doing it every day, which is where you’ll find the most impact on your feelings and life. So, I’ve picked that up again, and already it’s making a difference. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Related to this, I’ve also picked up Bullet Journaling again with a little more seriousness. If you haven’t read Ryder Carroll’s <em>The Bullet Journal Method</em> I highly recommend it. It is, as Ryder says, “a mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity system” so come for the lists, stay for just making you more attentive to your life. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>This week I’ve been reading…</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/style/lemonheads-evan-dando.html\">Evan Dando knows he’s lucky</a>. I can’t remember how I ended up with this year-old article, but it sparked many memories of the 90s. I saw The Lemonheads quite a few times, and <em>It’s a Shame About Ray</em> was one of the CDs in constant rotation. The last time I saw Dando, he was sat on top of a portaloo at Glastonbury playing his guitar to everyone queuing for a pee. I’m glad he’s still alive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n21/peter-geoghegan/cronyism-and-clientelism\">This Tory government smells of corruption</a>. It’s not just that they obviously think rules aren’t made for them, it’s that they see things like procurement process as inefficiencies, but don’t see the millions they are throwing at their friends in wasted projects as anything but “fail fast”. You don’t fail fast when you’re doing it with taxpayers money. You just fail. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s so much stuff about at the moment designed to help you work more effectively from home. <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/Workplace-Analytics/myanalytics/use/mya-adoption/indiv-adopt-resources\">This collection of articles and books</a> from Microsoft is excellent — not just for working from home, but also just working generally. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve been watching episodes of <em>The Computer Chronicles</em> quite a lot lately (they’re all available on a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkJ6eQKpHZgsZBla4JgKj3A\">YouTube channel</a>). It’s quite a blast from the past and makes me nostalgic for the era when computers were huge desk-bound machines which required you to type arcane commands in them to make even the most trivial things happen. I say trivial but at the time — we’re talking about the mid-1980s — what those computers could do was amazing. The idea that you could write a book and then go back and easily edit it was revolutionary. If you’re at all nostalgic about the earlier years of computing I recommend it. And yes, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/NY7AR_xmcQ8\">portable computers really used to look like that</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The earlier episodes feature Gary Kildall as co-host. Kildall was the inventory of CP/M, one of the most popular early microcomputer operating systems. According to legend, when IBM wanted an off-the-shelf operating system for their top secret IBM PC, Bill Gates pointed them in Kildall’s direction. Kildall, though, was out when the IBM people arrived — he spent a lot of time flying to visit customers — and his wife (co-owner of the business) wouldn’t sign the required NDA. So, we ended up with DOS, not CP/M on the IBM PC and Bill Gates as the richest man in the world. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another piece of my early computing history was<em> Byte Magazine</em> and Jerry Pournelle's column \"Computing at Chaos Manor\". Pournelle's columns were epics, rolling in at around 5000 words a month of rambling prose detailing what felt like every single computing action he took over the course of a month. <a href=\"https://www.jerrypournelle.com/computing/December98.html\">You can get a taste of one on his website</a>, which still looks like something from the late 90s.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I started reading Byte way back even before I bought my first computer. I was obsessed with science fiction and computers which you could actually own were like a taste of the future. And Byte was where you read all about it. Every month Pournelle would receive new equipment from vendors eager to get a mention in his column and having all that technology ¬¬– which I would have called “kit” at the time, a word I later went on to hate with a passion — sounded like a fun job.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It would be remiss not to mention that Pournelle was also a raging right-winger who consistently claimed climate change was a hoax and thought the democrats were all pawns of the Soviet Union. His fiction was often steeped in virulent militarism, and he got worse as he got older. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Eventually, of course I became a computer journalist which lead to a career in publishing and my current status as what can only be described as “a suit”. I may still wear the t-shirts, but my work is really people and business. Perhaps that’s why I’m still so obsessed with technology: it’s the link to my past.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Stuff I’ve been reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-review-forward-looking/\">Viticci’s review of the new iPad Air</a> is interesting and of course as in-depth as you would expect.

We’ve been seeing a lot of independent films lately, partly because I want to stay in the habit of going to the cinema and partly because… well… there isn’t much else on. A very big FU to Eon, who aren’t releasing James Bond and so are actually damaging cinemas that desperately need revenue (and yes, you can go to a cinema safely).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Seeing quite a few indie films has definitely rekindled my interest in movies, which has been bludgeoned into submission by years of mostly seeing huge films about people with various kinds of superpowers. One from last year that everyone ought to see is Olivia Wilde’s <em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/S0Mb6BgnhS0\">Booksmart</a></em> which is a sharp little comedy. I was reminded of it by something which arrived this week, Google’s new Chromecast with Google TV. Google TV is a revelation – it has a better interface for movie discovery than anything else I’ve found, and because it incorporates every streaming service<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> it works really well. It also supports movies that aren’t available to stream anywhere, letting you tell it that you want to add them to a watchlist or have seen it before, so it can base recommendations and alerts on even movies which aren’t available anywhere. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Rearrangements</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It’s funny how rearranging your working space can have such a big impact on how it feels to work. For months I’ve had my office space set out with the window to the side of me and my desk facing the wall (one with some lovely pictures on it, but still a wall. On something of a whim I decided to move the desk so that I am sitting facing outside, which means I get a glimpse of sunlight. I also did away with the (quite lovely) big monitor, replacing it with a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009SKN5DC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1\">12 South MacBook Stand</a> which works brilliantly with my MacBook Pro. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It also works really well with my iPad Pro, which sits up at a perfect height for typing and reminds me of the way <a href=\"https://mattgemmell.com/my-new-office/\">Matt Gemmell has his iPad-only work desk set up</a>.

Food tracking is a privacy nightmare, because all the main apps you can get for it use the data on what you’re eating to either advertise something to you or sell you some kind of expensive weight loss course.

Offices are Victorian, as much an invention of the Fordist Industrial Age as the production line. They are production lines for information: work passed (physically) from desk to desk in paper form. As the Information Age took over, we retained the same models because the documents we worked with had become digital, but they were confined to the physical office network.<br>Now, the documents and workflow are freed from this constraint. You can work from anywhere, and the information is where you are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All this means that role of the office is now about social space, more than work space. The serried ranks of desks are no longer required, but what is needed is to retain the high-bandwidth emotional connections with the colleagues you work with and that turns a collection of workers into a team.

The news that Apple is being sued by Epic Games means a whole new generation of technology journalists are about the learn a lot of the same stuff. It’s fun.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One thing to understand off the bat: in Europe, there’s an assumption that competition is good for consumers, and so things which restrict competition must have a VERY clear consumer benefit. No such assumption exists in the US, where immediate consumer harm is all that really matters. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is going to make things pretty tough for Epic, because Apple can ask “where’s the harm?” and Epic needs to do the work to show it. Just a restraint on Epic’s freedom to do what they hell they want won’t be enough. And Apple has a strong case that a single app store with a fixed fee has benefited consumers by providing developers with a clear route to market, as well as something that’s much more secure than mobile app distribution used to be. Anyone who remembers the pre-App Store era will know what a shambles it was trying to get mobile software if you weren’t a nerd. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Stuff I’ve been reading</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Ars Technica has a great interview with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/08/apple-explains-how-it-uses-machine-learning-across-ios-and-soon-macos/\">two of Apple’s leading AI experts</a>.

Apple and Microsoft have both produced high-quality multi-posture devices in the form of Surface Pro X and iPad Pro; Google has produced great pervasive hardware in the form of the Hub stuff. But when Apple or Microsoft has tried pervasive, it’s been second-rate (Siri, Cortana, HomePod). Likewise, when Google has tried its hard at multi-posture, it’s been terrible (Pixel Slate).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m very curious about why this should be.

A folding single screen is only ever one thing: its small screen is simply a smaller version of the whole thing unfolded. Two screens on the other hand have to be true to what they are – they can’t really pretend to be a single spread with a huge bar in the middle. Folding the device makes it into a different thing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Danny wrote a terrific thing about the <a href=\"https://www.oblomovka.com/wp/2020/07/20/spoolfeed-or-the-new-news/\">fundamental unit of news being the story, not the article</a>, to which I say a resounding YES.

Of course that means I spent the first few days being anxious about work, something that’s a pattern I’ve had throughout my working life. At the back of my head there’s always the feeling that something is going wrong, that there are things left open that I absolutely must deal with. It fades after a few days, but on a one-week holiday by the time that feeling has declined I am almost at the point where I want to start working again. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have a <em>terrible</em> relationship with work and relaxation, but that’s an improvement over what it used to be, which was basically catastrophic. Back in the late 90s/early 00s I would end up with four weeks holiday left to take in December, which both made my managers want to strangle me and also meant I was constantly on the edge. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But <strong>eventually,</strong> I switch off, usually just in time to go back to work. This time round it will be a bit strange, of course, as I won’t physically be going anywhere. While the government is urging companies to open up, sensible ones are promoting working from home for everyone that can feasibly do it. It is great we’re getting re-evaluate work and office spaces.

Often, that comes from managers who operate that way themselves: who send emails outside of hours because they work outside of hours, who work all the way through weekends and simply don’t understand if people aren’t as “engaged” with work as they are.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They’re adopting the tropes of modern management, without recognising that people have different needs and desires and this kind of working just doesn’t work for everyone. It’s not agile, it’s abusive. And weirdly, I often see this pattern in the most liberal (with a small l) people, who are <em>horrified</em> if they’re challenged about it. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve seen a similar pattern in others, who start off wanting to remake the establishment, then they <strong>become</strong> the establishment. In every new role, they hire the same faces, so they can “get things done quickly”, and don’t realise that what they are doing is outdated now — and of course also means they’re operating a new kind of the old school tie.

First impressions are very positive. They’re really nice and light, easy to wear, and having the Google Assistant there on demand is nice. Bluetooth's performance is adequate. The range is great — I can basically leave my Pixel 4 XL in the living room and wander round the whole house without drop-outs — but there’s an occasional crackle and drop out and back in again, which many people have complained about. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How do they compare to the AirPods Pro?

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When I left school in 1983 my ambitions boiled down to owning a van and being in a band. The two things were not unconnected: I was a terrible keyboard player (punk, yo) but if I owned a van the band would still need me to cart the equipment around from gig to gig, free festival to free festival.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I never bought a van – in fact, I never learned to drive – but neither did I replace that ambition with another. Leaving school at the age of 16, with four CSEs at the height of Thatcher’s era of mass unemployment basically meant I had no expectation of ever even working. And if I did, it would be a shitty job, probably in a shitty shop. When a local Wickes store opened, I applied and didn’t even get a reply, let alone an interview. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The trajectory of my escape from that world is long and complex and deserves its own piece of writing, but the important point is this: <em>I had no ambitions</em>. Ambitions were something that other people had, but not working class kids from Derby. I had dreams, sure. But there was no possible path from here to there. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since then, though, ambitions have become the playground of the young, and there’s been an expectation actually rooted in reality that a young person’s ambitions can be fulfilled. You could travel and work in Europe. You could go to university. You could get a job, buy a house, something that so so few of your parents were able to do. Some of these simple things moved from ambitious dreams to expectations. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The past ten years have chipped away at this. A house has become something no one can afford unless they can rely on the bank of mum and dad, while the media bombards you with messages about how it’s your own fault you can’t save a hundred thousand pounds. Jobs which offer long-term careers and progression have been eroded, to the point of destruction. There is no such thing as job security if you are young. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Brexit and COVID, though, have been the twin hammer blows which have destroyed the opportunities of the young. Brexit’s retreat to cosy little Englander fantasies of an idealised 1950s Britain mean putting up borders and robbing the young of a core part of their identity, while reducing the ability of the poorest to up sticks and work wherever they can across the continent. Looking abroad for work was one of the few routes out of Thatcher’s newly-impoverished Britain when I left school, and that option just won’t exist the young poor in a few months time. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But it is probably COVID which will have a longer term impact, and which will break the back of ambition, particularly for those reaching maturity now. In a long and brilliant Twitter thread, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sime0nStylites/status/1256912098187190272?s=20\">David Hayward wrote</a> that “a pandemic is a killer of the dreams of the young” and nothing could be closer to the truth. I have been lucky to live for 53 years in a bubble of safety, with the freedom to roam and to dream. Until we find a vaccine, that freedom is basically gone. Who can have ambitions, who can have dreams, when the next person you meet might be the one that passes on a deadly virus rather than the person who changes your life for the better? </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>Some notes on anger</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve found myself getting astonishingly angry over the course of the week. There’s a lot to be angry about, but anger never sits well on me for long. The anger is, of course, well placed. Whether you’re angry about the government’s utter incompetence over COVID-19, the structural and personal racism which oppresses black people the world over, or a famous author’s transphobia (and yes, please, let’s not call it anything else), there is much to be angry about.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve come to see social media in general and Twitter in particular as forces for ill in society, not good. That puts in me a small minority: there’s still <a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/\">plenty of people in tech</a> who see the effects of social media as, on balance, a social good. When you see the impact that the awful death of George Floyd had, amplified to billions of people via social media, then you can see their point. Perhaps, now, we will get real change.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But anyone who has worked in social media management will tell you that the way to maximise your reach isn’t to make well-honed arguments but to to provoke emotion, and there is no better emotion to provoke in politics than anger. Twitter is a hate machine. We mock Trump’s Twitter use, but he’s a master at it, because he understands the fundamental rule: when you have people angry, if you want to reach more people, get them more angry still. Pile anger on to anger, until the world is burning.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Social media spread the news of George Floyd’s death further and with more impact than any other medium in history could have, and that is undoubtedly a good thing. But social media doesn’t give us any way out of the anger. It doesn’t give us any “and now what”. All it can do is keep making us more angry, because it rewards making you feel, not making you think. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But anger alone isn’t enough to solve social problems and, worse still, <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/culture-shrink/201508/angers-allure-are-you-addicted-anger\">it’s addictive</a>. It feels good, and it overrides the moral brakes in your brain. Anger drives hate-filled cops as well as justified protests. It’s a way to feel powerful in the moment, to feel in control of things that they have no control over.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That makes it doubly dangerous. Not only does it mean you lose control and do things beyond your own moral framework, but it’s gives you the delusion that you’ve already achieved something. Protestors throwing rocks today will have no more power tomorrow than they had yesterday, but get a sense of accomplishment. They feel like they’ve already made a difference.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:separator -->\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n<!-- /wp:separator -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":2} -->\n<h2>Getting off social media</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Related to all this: Inspired by a conversation with Phil Gyford I’ve set myself the task of writing something on how to remove yourself from Facebook while preserving the benefits of Facebook.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Technically, of course, it’s easy. There’s plenty of platforms which deliver the functionality of Facebook in a more open and ethical way. The challenge is actually <em>discoverability.</em></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The one unalloyed good that Facebook has brought to my life is that it’s genuinely brought me closer to my family. When your parents are alive, they’re often the glue that binds together you and your relatives. They tell you what’s going on, they keep track of who is where, and who has done what to whom. Then they die, and that bond with the extend family vanishes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Facebook lets you preserve those bonds, but also makes it easier to rediscover them. Without Facebook, I wouldn’t be in touch with my Aunt Shiela, my dad’s last remaining sibling, who lives in Cypress. I wouldn’t be in touch with so many of my cousins, who prior to everyone being on Facebook I wouldn’t have known how to contact. And none of them would have been able to find me, either.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So the real issue with replacing Facebook isn’t “how do you remake the experience” but “how do you make yourself as easily discoverable”?

I couldn’t concentrate, and my eyes just started closing. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I promptly slept from 9am till 9pm, when I woke up and soon enough fell asleep again.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since then tiredness has been an ever-present factor in my life, and I’ve learned to manage it so I get the most important things done in the morning. This week, that feeling has been back with a vengeance. I don’t know if this is the start of some kind of post-illness fatigue syndrome or what, but at one point in the early evening I was lying on the small sofa and was so tired that I literally felt my arms slump to my side as I passed out. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m hoping this will pass, but if not, I’ll embrace it and just get up earlier. You can only do what you can do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1>Big-picture productivity</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A few weeks ago I signed up to Pater Akkies’ “<a href=\"https://peterakkies.net/products/big-picture-productivity\">Big Picture Productivity</a>” course, and I’ve just completed the second module. I discovered Peter through YouTube – where I discover 90% of people these days – where he’s put a series of really nice videos on setting up Things, OmniFocus and some other tools. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The course is really good, and I’d recommend it to most people. The modules released so far have been on the basic productivity strategies of thinking about your values and roles then working through what your goals are. Once you’ve done that it’s time to work out what the actionable projects are which lead to your goals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I like Peter’s avoidance of the SMARTER framework which everyone uses for goals. One thing that I’ve come to understand is that some goals don’t have an end: for example, a goal of reducing your carbon emissions isn’t ever going to end, but it’s still a goal. The projects you put together to achieve that should have something closer to a smarter framework, but the goal itself can be ongoing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Peter has also <strong>finally</strong>got me using <a href=\"http://notion.so\">Notion</a>, which I’ve resisted for a long time. A notes app that is really a database sounds too much like the kind of thing that I would spend about a year tinkering with to get it <em>just so</em> while never actually using. But Peter’s course shows you how you can use it to track goals and projects in a way that I really like. I’ll still use my Bullet Journal for my day-to-day note taking, but when I need something more serious I can see how Notion fits in. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1>Tot</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The other big discovery of the week is <a href=\"https://ianbetteridge.com/2020/05/31/tot/\">Tot</a>, which I’ve written about extensively already so I won’t dwell on it too much. However, it’s a great example of an application which uses a limitation as a fundamental feature to nudge someone towards a better behaviour. We need more of that. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1>Music</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For some reason I ended up listening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLEnIVkhmi0\">“I’m a tree” by Imani Coppola </a>AKA the single that almost sank her career. After having a big hit with her first song, top 20 worldwide and all that kind of thing, this one was released and promptly charted… absolutely nowhere. Well, it scraped the top 200 in Australia. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1>Culture</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/graysons-art-club\">Grayson’s Art Club</a> is of course fantastic. There’s a long-running battle in our house over which of is Grayson and which is Philippa. I’m also really enthused by the amount of talks that museums and art galleries are making available virtually while we’re all stuck at home, plus the new range of plays and ballets available on YouTube. At least, the internet is enabling democratic culture. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As well, of course, as resurgent nationalism, but we will talk no more of that. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

And when I used the Mac version I knew it was something I <strong>really</strong> wanted on my Mac.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At its heart, Tot is a scratch pad. It's just a place to jot down little snippets of text, often that you will use elsewhere.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There’s only seven documents, called dots, represented by – you guessed it – a series of dots along the top of the window. If a dot has text in it, it has a colour fill (you can change this for accessibility purposes – a nice touch).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This conceit of seven <strong>and only seven</strong> possible “documents” is what makes Tot so good. It places a limitation on what the user can do which nudges you towards a particular kind of behaviour. Applications like Drafts or Apple Notes allow you to keep on making more and more new documents and that encourages you to never actually look back on what you’re written.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The seven-dot limitation of Tot means you can’t do that: if you keep taking notes, as soon as you hit that seven dot limit you’re going to have to go back through what you’re written and either delete something or, if it’s still valuable, move it elsewhere.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are some other cute little interface touches, all of which remind me quite why I love the Iconfactory’s software. You can have Tot set up either as a menu bar icon or a dock icon. If you have it in the dock, the icon changes to match the colour of the front-most dot.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can set a keystroke to invoke it on the Mac and there’s a smart set of keyboard shortcuts which let you move forward and back through dots without taking your hands off the keys. You’d be surprised how many text applications don’t have proper navigation like this. There’s also, I’m pleased to say, Touch Bar support.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Mac version is free: the iOS version is $20. That sounds like a lot for an iOS app, but in the great history of what you can charge for software it’s peanuts. I paid more than that for ridiculous shareware games in the past. And as <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/apps-were-trying-tot/\">Mike Schmitt on Sweet Setup</a> points out, for an app this simple a subscription model just doesn’t make any sense.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And the iOS version is excellent, working exactly how you would expect it. If you’re using an iPad with a keyboard then you will find all the keyboard short cuts you have on the Mac version. To switch between dots, you can just swipe across the screen with a single finger. Again, it’s simple, but you can see and touch (literally) the thought that has gone into making it easy.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The iPadOS version really comes into its own when used in a Slide Over window. It’s <em>ideal</em> in this kind of scenario. Of course you can use it full screen, or split view, but when you have it in Slide Over you can see the screen and take notes easily from what you’re working on, or just drag and drop text or links from your “main” view.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The key question with any new software, though, is “what can you actually use it for?” For me, it’s all about jotting down random thoughts and ideas that I’ll take and do something with later – this blog post started life as a set of jottings in a single dot, and then moved to Ulysses once I thought I had enough to start writing a full blog post on it. And the nice thing is that when I exported to Ulysses, all my links and formatting just dropped right in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

Unlike its distant relative MERS, which makes people ill fast and kills them before they get chance to infect many others, it creeps up on you. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In fact, for the majority of sufferers, they will remain ambulatory. They may have outward signs, like a cough, but they may not - and our culture has trained us to keep going if we feel under the weather, to ignore symptoms. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It hits us when economically we're weak to it. Zero hours contracts mean there is a pool of people who have no choice but to keep working, and a set of businesses that are built around the idea that you don't have to keep people on staff. If you're under 50, you've never really experienced a dangerous infectious disease that spreads like this. Yes, there was HIV, but that could mostly be avoided.

I got my immunity (such as it is) to measles, mumps, scarlet fever and German measles the hard way, by contracting the disease. And I remember the steps my parents had to take to keep me isolated (no playing outside, stuck in my bedroom, no friends visiting, EXTRA COMICS) because some of those diseases could kill other children. And, of course, could have killed me, although their undoubted worry didn’t register at the time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re younger than me, you’ve grown up in a world where most of the major childhood infectious diseases didn’t exist: you’re used to infection being something that either you didn’t have to worry about (colds, seasonal flu) or affected someone else, somewhere else. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And if you’re older than me (OK, boomer)... well, you should know better. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The generations currently alive are probably the first in history not to have anyone who remembers the last global pandemic in them. The influenza of 1918 was a distant memory to my grandmother, born in 1910, but for anyone of my mother’s age or younger – everyone currently alive – the danger of pandemic has faded from the collective memory. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Having lost the folk memory, all we have to keep us cautious and keep us alive is the knowledge of experts, and yet we also live at a time when major Western countries have turned away from an understanding of the important of expertise. Brexit, the pride in ignorance that characterises Trumpism, all show us that the respect for expertise which built post-war prosperity has vanished. Even amongst my generation, the notion of the “wisdom of crowds” tell us that while everyone can’t be an Einstein, if we all click our heels and wish three times, a hundred of us can add up to one. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No one is going to crowdsource a new treatment for COVID.

The old, early internet idea that “good information drives out bad” is probably still being touted by the Digerati somewhere, but it’s really now pretty laughable. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And of course the news that your local supermarket is running out of bread can spread faster than ever, letting the well-off drive down in their cars and buy up the last remaining stocks to put in their chest freezers, while the poorer wait for a bus and find shelves empty.

COVID almost seems tailor made to capitalise on every single weakness in our culture, from expert denial and anti-vaccine madness to our lack of experience of pandemic to the way our economy is structured.

Of course, ChromeOS needs to keep pace with web APIs and – in true Google style – push them forward. And there are definitely areas for improvement, like biometric support (as David highlights). You can improve the interface, as all OS’ should.\n\nBut what else do you want ChromeOS to do, other than be the best platform for running the web apps which 90% of users care about?\n\n<em>This post was written and posted on an iPad Pro, another device where you can’t do any creative work and that isn’t really suitable for professionals. </em>\n",

You spend the first day of the year thinking about all the things you want to achieve and by this day you’ve broken your promises to yourself, forgotten about the things you want to get done, and wondered at what point in your life one day hangovers turned into two day hangovers.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don’t worry. We have all done this.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have an ambivalent relationship with goals. On the one hand, goals add value and, if chosen well, meaning to your life. On the other hand, goals can be stifling, endless wells of disappointment and failure.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’ve ever done any kind of personal development course you’ve probably been told to make goals SMARTER (the personal development industry loves an acronym). And for some things, SMARTER really is better. If you want to pay off your credit card debt then being specific about when you’re going to do it and making sure it’s an achievable thing is good idea.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But not everything you want to do in life is SMARTER. And the peril with trying to apply the same framework to everything you want to do is that you end up feeling bad when you start something only to find out you don’t care enough about it to actually keep going.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, you need to start small and just find out if something is right or possible for you. For example, I’m interested in photography, and – as I don’t have any hobbies and know I need something other than work in my life – I want to see if it’s something I enjoy. I could set myself a SMARTER goal on this: “By the end of January I will have found and enrolled in a photography course”, say. But suppose I look around, read some course descriptions, and find that actually it all sounds dreadful and I can’t get excited about it? Have I FAILED in my goal?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The best advice I’ve seen about goals is Ryder Carroll’s in <em>The Bullet Journal Method, </em>where he talks about splitting goals into sprints, little two week chunks which achieve something in themselves – each sprint is complete in that sense – but achieve something within that overall goal. And importantly, if after a sprint you find you want to head off in a different direction from where your goal was leading, that’s fine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes, all a goal is is an opportunity to learn about something and maybe take it further. So start small, and be forgiving. Never forget that it’s fine to decide that something which looked important to you before you started is not something you want to pursue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everything you do is a chance to learn.  The only time you learn nothing is if you do nothing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_text": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Earlier this year I bought myself a shiny new Mac. This was the first Mac I’d bought since 2015, when I bought the 12in MacBook, a machine which lasted me four years but which was starting to struggle a little with battery life and a few other things.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Mac I chose was one of the new retina MacBook Airs, the base model. As you can guess from the fact that a Core m3 MacBook was capable being my main machine for four years, I’m not a particularly demanding power user. I’m not running Photoshop, I don’t have to compile code. Mostly, I write, I do spreadsheets, and I browse the web. Mostly spreadsheets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Air is nice. Having TouchID built in is great, the keyboard is adequate, it’s fast enough and although it only has 128GB of storage, in the age of cloud applications and sync engines that are smart enough to work out what to sync and what you don’t ever use, that’s actually not as much of an issue for most people as you’d think.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But I don’t love it. Unlike the MacBook, which for at least two of the years I used it was an absolute darling of a machine, the MacBook Air has just always felt a little half hearted. There’s nothing <em>wrong</em> with it, but it’s probably the first Mac I’ve ever owned that I just don’t love.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Meanwhile on the other side of the Mac/Windows divide, Microsoft has released the Surface Pro X, and it’s as if they basically created a computer purpose-built to press all of my technology lust buttons. It’s light and portable – I love light and portable – and at the cutting edge thanks to its ARM processor. It’s got LTE built in, something I’ve been desperate for on a Mac for years, and something that made me use my iPad a lot. Oh and it’s a tablet too, and I absolutely adore tablets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I don’t think I’ve prevaricated about buying a computer more than over the Surface Pro X. On the day it was announced, I added it to my basket on the Microsoft store. On the next day, I took it out. Repeat that three times and you’ll have an idea of how much I agonised over whether to buy one or not.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The reviews, when they came out a week or so before release, should have made up my mind that this was not a device for me. And yet… Reader, I bought one. And not just the lowest end one: I went for the fully tricked out 16GB of RAM and 512GB of SSD version, because if this thing is going to be my main computing device for a few years, I want some future proofing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>Pricey. No, REALLY pricey</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You are of course paying through the nose for all this. Even for the base model, you’ll barely get change out of £1200 once you’ve bought the keyboard (yes, you need this) and pen. Even if you’re lucky enough to get an education discount, you’re still looking at a machine that starts expensive and moves quickly to the level of pricing that will make trigger automatic offers by your credit card company to raise your limit. If you want the fully-loaded 16Gb of RAM and 512GB storage version, you’re going to pay the best part of £2,000.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>What you get for that money is basically what all computers should be like in 2019. Silent, always connected, light, with a great typing experience and an amazing screen. Usable in a variety of modes, and equally adept in all of them. It’s a computer that makes you feel productive.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’ve always believed that Apple makes the best hardware in the business, and in some areas this is true (the new iPhone 11 is shockingly good). But when it comes to computers, Microsoft now beats it, pretty easily. It’s arguably better than the design of the iPad Pro, and I <em>love</em> that device.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":1} -->\n<h1>Hardware without software is a paperweight</h1>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As an iPad user allow me a moment of schadenfreude: One of the biggest criticisms of the iPad from the Windows community has been its failure to run “real” desktop apps “like Photoshop”. Now, the leading edge of Microsoft devices is something which also can’t run Photoshop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news is that the vast majority of applications that I use on a day-to-day basis are already ported to 64-bit ARM, which means I get good performance out of them. Using ARM applications also improves the battery life: whatever emulation system Microsoft is using to run Win32, it pushes the processor hard enough to significantly decrease how long you’ll be using the Surface Pro X without plugging it in. It’s still not bad – but you’ll definitely get a better experience if you can go ARM-only or ARM-mostly. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>By and large, if you’re using ARM applications you’re going to find the experience of using the Surface Pro X really positive. That means most of Microsoft’s own apps, including – of course – Office (but weirdly not Teams), plus some staples like Spotify and WhatsApp Desktop.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Surface Pro X can also run 32-bit Intel apps… but “run” is sometimes a generous way of putting it. It’s hit and miss whether an app will run properly, and if it does run at all, it can be prone to random freezes and crashes.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>iTunes is a good example of this. It’s a Microsoft Store app, and it’s Win32, so it should work fine. But whenever I used it, it would randomly lock up while trying to do innocuous things like switching to a playlist. 1Password works, but the desktop client is slow and painful to use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, there’s now an ARM version of the new Edge browser, and Edge lets you run pretty much any web site as an application that appears in your task bar, you can run apps like Apple Music and Slack as web apps rather than their native equivalents. Because Microsoft has got into Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in a big way, this is actually a good experience. And 1Password has a Chrome extension version – 1Password X – which is almost as fully-featured as the client, which means you can run it as part of the browser since Chrome extensions work well with the new Edge.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>The right device for me… but maybe not for you</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you’re the kind of person who lives in Office 365 and browser-based applications, you’re going to find performance on the Surface Pro X is good, battery life is excellent, and built in LTE is wonderful. Microsoft has built the best device for experiencing its own software, and if you live a Microsoft life you’re going to love it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This describes my computing world at the moment, so unsurprisingly I love this device. Ironically, it was my experience with the iPad Pro that helped me understand the Surface Pro X could work for me. I’ve never had a problem using the iPad Pro for almost all my work and a sizeable bit of play. I’m mostly deep into the Office 365 ecosystem, and the iPad Office apps are good. And I also knew from the iPad that ARM is capable of more than enough performance to support everything I want to do.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And remember too that for three years a MacBook was my everyday carry work machine. I’ve lived the life of USB C-only for a while. I know that performance is less important to me than lightness. The iPad taught me that integrated LTE and an all-day battery was also very high on my list of requirements.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All computers are inherently a compromise between size, design, performance, mobility and ease of use. You can buy a beast of a gaming “laptop” that weighs a tonne but absolutely screams at</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So does anyone want to buy a barely-used MacBook Air?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

When it was initially revealed, there was a level of excitement around it which built a big bubble of hype. When it was finally released that bubble burst, spectacularly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The Slate had a lot of problems. There were performance issues in tablet mode, which meant doing something as simple as having two windows snap side by side was a laggy experience. There was the design of the Keyboard Cover, which made the device almost impossible to use in your lap unless you had the kind of length of thigh bone that would place you into NBA levels of height (or extremely weirdly shaped legs).</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the biggest and most damaging question was one that should have been obvious to Google prior to launch: why should you buy the Pixel Slate when the Pixelbook still exists, and even though it has an older processor and bezels as wide as the Grand Canyon it actually did everything that anyone would want from a Chromebook, in a more familiar form?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I have both a Pixelbook and a Pixel Slate. I had expected the Pixel Slate to effectively replace the Pixelbook. All the things the critics said are true about the Slate, and that’s why I never sold the Slate -- but despite the Pixelbook being, in many ways, a superior device I still love using the Slate, and just when I think I’ve put it down for good it finds a way to sneak back into my life. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Why? The first reason is the screen -- and no, I’m not talking about the bezels. I can live with the bezels on the Pixelbook, and the reality is that those on the Slate are not that much smaller. But the screen itself is genuinely joyful to look at over a long period of time. The only screen that I’ve ever used that rivals it is the iPad Pro, which is the best screen on the planet for ordinary use at the moment. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Images on the screen are soft without lacking sharpness or clarity. Colours are absolutely perfect. I can look at this screen for a long, long time without wanting a break (note: I do take breaks anyway, and you should too!)</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second reason the Pixel Slate keeps luring me back is the keyboard. Yes, I know: you can’t use it in your lap, and it has to lie flat on a table because there are no clever magnets to keep it angled up like there are on the Surface Pro keyboards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But the keys themselves are brilliant to type on. Round keys take a little while to get used to, but Google’s user testing was right. I find myself making less typing errors on it, and when you type all day that adds up to a lot of time spent not doing corrections. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Also, one for Apple: find a way to steal the bit from this keyboard that lets you put it at any angle. The two angles on the iPad Pro keyboard are a big improvement, but they just don’t cut it when you’re used to being able to work at any angle, as you can on the Pixel Slate.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I can’t speak for the lower end versions but the Core i5 that I have in my Slate performs perfectly well now, in laptop or tablet mode. Everything feels as snappy as you would expect. And battery life is fine: you can never have enough battery life, but the Slate will get me through a full typical working day. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I think the biggest problem the Slate faced was that Google never really answered a simple question for themselves: Why make a tablet at all? What role is this device going to play in someone’s life? If it’s going to replace a laptop (or even “replace a laptop 80-90% of the time”) then it needs to be better than a laptop at a wide range of tasks. The iPad is the best example of this: it’s got a better screen, it’s easier to use, the battery lasts and lasts, it’s more powerful given the price, it has really good software, it integrates brilliantly if you have an iPhone, it’s hugely better for consuming content, and thanks to that processor power and easy to use software  it’s often better for consumer-level content creation. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And yet… I doubt I’ll ever regret buying the Slate. It’s a big barrel of contradictions and half thought out ideas, but it’s also just one of the most pleasant and compelling devices I own. Even when it’s frustrating you over some little thing, it’s a joyful piece of design that misses the mark in places but delivers in others. <br></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Never let a bunch of people decide anything that you have to do via a Twitter poll. In my case, very definitely don’t let them condemn you to a week-long trial of any product other than the ones you favour.\nThat’s how I ended up spending a week or so using the Google Pixel 3 XL rather than my beloved iPhone XS Max. My Apple Watch sat on the sidelines and in its place on my wrist came a Fossil Sport watch running Wear OS.\nI gave it a shot. But how did it actually do? And did I end up tearing my hair out?</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Top of the list: Google Assistant. Although there are a couple of ways that Assistant is worse than Siri, by and large it’s a huge step upwards. Even though it still hasn’t got totally to grips with my accent (no, Google, “hole” does not mean the same thing as “hall”. I do not have any lights in my hole) Assistant’s ability to answer queries and generally get things done is outstanding.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>First, there was FaceID. Once you’ve got used to just glancing at your phone and opening it up instantly, going back to having to press your finger on a fingerprint reader makes you feel like you have gone back to some kind of technological dark age.</p>\n<p>Next there’s Siri. Now I know that I said Google Assistant was way ahead — and it is — but there’s one area that Siri still stands head and shoulders above its Google rival, and that’s home automation. Even after all this time, Google Assistant does not understand that homes have different regions where you might want to turn off and on a bunch of lights: or, as we sometimes call them, “upstairs and downstairs”.</p>\n<p>Apps, too, are still behind. There are plenty of streak trackers, but none as good as Streaks. There are plenty of task lists, but none as good as either OmniFocus or Things. Google Fit is fine, but as a hub for all your health information, it’s laughable compared to Apple Health and as a fitness app it’s not as good as Fitness.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the hardware and software eco-system and how everything just works together. You would think this might be an area where Google could lead, but instead it lags. Android and Chrome OS still feel like strangers sitting next to each other on a train, rather than a couple.</p>\n<p>Then there’s Apple Watch: boy, did I miss Apple Watch. Although I used a pretty decent recent wear OS device (the Fossil Sport), it’s pretty laughable as a wearable. Design-wise, the hardware is fine: this, after all, is a company that knows how to make good looking objects for your wrist. But the software and speed of the device itself are probably compatible to a first generation Apple Watch. Google Assistant, which should be a star on the wrist, is a laggy joke. And the lack of decent applications makes it pretty useless on the whole.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And it is a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->really<!-- raw HTML omitted --> good camera, capable of producing consistently excellent images across a huge range of lighting conditions. You just won’t get many duff shots out of the Pixel 3.</p>\n<p>However, what you are not getting is anything close to images that are true to life, and every now and then the computational photography approach just completely messes up. Portrait mode, for example, will do wacky things like blur out the frame of someone’s glasses rather than correctly interpreting them as part of the face. Occasionally, the Pixel’s desire to make colours pop out at every opportunity also betrays it. For example, taking a wide picture of a kitchen while a friend was cooking, the Pixel decided that because they were wearing a yellow sweater, it should also add a pale yellow tinge to their face. Perhaps that algorithm needs to learn that “jaundiced” isn’t a natural human skin tone.</p>\n<p>Portrait mode is also an interesting area. When the iPhone XS Max first came out, Apple’s algorithms for portrait mode over-smoothed skin to a crazy degree. Apple has tweaked these since, and now it’s the Pixel 3’s face smoothing looks over done. It’s not bad: but as soon as you look closely at an image, it’s pretty obvious what the Pixel is trying to do.</p>\n<p>Then there’s Night Sight. This is widely – and rightly – regarded as something of a miracle. Even outside, on a pretty dark night with little illumination to work with I can get a clear shot of what’s going on in the garden. But it’s also <!-- raw HTML omitted -->weird<!-- raw HTML omitted --> looking, like <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jeff Brouws<!-- raw HTML omitted --> work, and looks absolutely nothing like what you’re seeing in front of you.</p>\n<p>There’s no optical zoom on the Pixel 3. And amazingly, you will very rarely care, because Google has done an absolutely amazing job of creating a digital zoom that’s almost as good as having a second lens. Almost – but not quite. This is an area where optics will always beat computation, but unless you’re constantly using zoom, the digital zoom on the Pixel will make you very happy indeed. Good job, Google.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you are not going to go wrong with either of these cameras. Is the camera better than the iPhone XS Max? It depends on what kinds of images you prefer. Do you want something that looks more or less like what you’re seeing in front of you? The iPhone is your better option. Do you want something that’s “better” in the sense of brighter, more energetic and with lighting that looks bright but not over-lit? The Pixel is probably the camera for you.

				"content_text": "Never let a bunch of people decide anything that you have to do via a Twitter poll. In my case, very definitely don’t let them condemn you to a week-long trial of any product other than the ones you favour.\nThat’s how I ended up spending a week or so using the Google Pixel 3 XL rather than my beloved iPhone XS Max. My Apple Watch sat on the sidelines and in its place on my wrist came a Fossil Sport watch running Wear OS.\nI gave it a shot. But how did it actually do? And did I end up tearing my hair out?\n<h1>What's better</h1>\nI’m going to leave the camera to one side for a while, but there are a few areas where the Pixel 3 XL is a clear winner.\n\nTop of the list: Google Assistant. Although there are a couple of ways that Assistant is worse than Siri, by and large it’s a huge step upwards. Even though it still hasn’t got totally to grips with my accent (no, Google, “hole” does not mean the same thing as “hall”. I do not have any lights in my hole) Assistant’s ability to answer queries and generally get things done is outstanding.\n<h1>What did I miss?</h1>\nThere were quite a few things though which made me constantly want to run back to iPhone. Mostly, they were small, but when you start to add up the small things, they matter.\n\nFirst, there was FaceID. Once you’ve got used to just glancing at your phone and opening it up instantly, going back to having to press your finger on a fingerprint reader makes you feel like you have gone back to some kind of technological dark age.\n\nNext there’s Siri. Now I know that I said Google Assistant was way ahead — and it is — but there’s one area that Siri still stands head and shoulders above its Google rival, and that’s home automation. Even after all this time, Google Assistant does not understand that homes have different regions where you might want to turn off and on a bunch of lights: or, as we sometimes call them, “upstairs and downstairs”.\n\nApps, too, are still behind. There are plenty of streak trackers, but none as good as Streaks. There are plenty of task lists, but none as good as either OmniFocus or Things. Google Fit is fine, but as a hub for all your health information, it’s laughable compared to Apple Health and as a fitness app it’s not as good as Fitness.\n\nThen there’s the hardware and software eco-system and how everything just works together. You would think this might be an area where Google could lead, but instead it lags. Android and Chrome OS still feel like strangers sitting next to each other on a train, rather than a couple.\n\nThen there’s Apple Watch: boy, did I miss Apple Watch. Although I used a pretty decent recent wear OS device (the Fossil Sport), it’s pretty laughable as a wearable. Design-wise, the hardware is fine: this, after all, is a company that knows how to make good looking objects for your wrist. But the software and speed of the device itself are probably compatible to a first generation Apple Watch. Google Assistant, which should be a star on the wrist, is a laggy joke. And the lack of decent applications makes it pretty useless on the whole.\n<h1>That camera</h1>\nOf course, there’s one thing that I really haven’t touched on much here: the camera. The Pixel 3 series is widely regarded as one of the best, if not the best, camera on a smartphone at the moment. Google achieves this not through hardware – although there’s certainly nothing back about the 12 megapixel rear-facing camera – but through its “computational photography”, machine learning algorithms which use multiple shots, the shake of your hand, and other features to improve every single image.\n\nAnd it is a <strong>really</strong> good camera, capable of producing consistently excellent images across a huge range of lighting conditions. You just won’t get many duff shots out of the Pixel 3.\n\nHowever, what you are not getting is anything close to images that are true to life, and every now and then the computational photography approach just completely messes up. Portrait mode, for example, will do wacky things like blur out the frame of someone’s glasses rather than correctly interpreting them as part of the face. Occasionally, the Pixel’s desire to make colours pop out at every opportunity also betrays it. For example, taking a wide picture of a kitchen while a friend was cooking, the Pixel decided that because they were wearing a yellow sweater, it should also add a pale yellow tinge to their face. Perhaps that algorithm needs to learn that “jaundiced” isn’t a natural human skin tone.\n\nPortrait mode is also an interesting area. When the iPhone XS Max first came out, Apple’s algorithms for portrait mode over-smoothed skin to a crazy degree. Apple has tweaked these since, and now it’s the Pixel 3’s face smoothing looks over done. It’s not bad: but as soon as you look closely at an image, it’s pretty obvious what the Pixel is trying to do.\n\nThen there’s Night Sight. This is widely – and rightly – regarded as something of a miracle. Even outside, on a pretty dark night with little illumination to work with I can get a clear shot of what’s going on in the garden. But it’s also <em>weird</em> looking, like <a href=\"http://www.jeffbrouws.com\">Jeff Brouws</a> work, and looks absolutely nothing like what you’re seeing in front of you.\n\nThere’s no optical zoom on the Pixel 3. And amazingly, you will very rarely care, because Google has done an absolutely amazing job of creating a digital zoom that’s almost as good as having a second lens. Almost – but not quite. This is an area where optics will always beat computation, but unless you’re constantly using zoom, the digital zoom on the Pixel will make you very happy indeed. Good job, Google.\n\nAt the end of the day, you are not going to go wrong with either of these cameras. Is the camera better than the iPhone XS Max? It depends on what kinds of images you prefer. Do you want something that looks more or less like what you’re seeing in front of you? The iPhone is your better option. Do you want something that’s “better” in the sense of brighter, more energetic and with lighting that looks bright but not over-lit? The Pixel is probably the camera for you. The colours you end up with on screen will look great – but they will be nothing like the colours that your eye will have seen at the time.\n<h1>What next?</h1>\nSo am I going to stick with the Pixel? Nope. I’m too embedded in the Apple hardware ecosystem and too much in love with Apple Watch to make that leap for too long. But I am going to spend some more time with it, and in particular I’m going to spend some time with Android Q.\n\nAndroid Q’s third developer beta just came out, and for a bit of fun I decided to install it – and I very much like what I’ve seen so far. The gesture interface (which is <strong>so</strong> copied from iOS) is more consistent and coherent than the current version, and I like the dark mode even if – as yet – not many applications support it.\n\nNow you’ll have to excuse me, as I have some SIM swapping to do…\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/96552/2024/705d913136.jpg\"> \n",

That’s dangerous. It usually starts with checking social media, reading slack, and catching up on email. The trick is to decide what you are going to do before you approach the computer.</blockquote>\nIn other words – and this is something I come back a lot at the moment – <strong>be intentional about what you're doing.</strong> If you're just sitting there with a device playing around with it, you're not doing anything that's actually of value.

Instead, it took place afterwards, in a bar, with some of the old-school printing trade press journalists (in the days when there was such a thing as the printing trade press). Listening to them talk, I realised the fundamental thing: Journalism is gossip. Professionalised, occasionally slightly pissed, but gossip nevertheless. <em>I could do this.</em> I had never wanted to be a journalist, but suddenly and permanently I had found my home.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>And boy did it feel good. For the next ten years or so, I did every kind of technology journalism: reviews, features, columns, and my favourite of all, <strong>news</strong>. Newswriting was always the best kind of reporting because it was the place where you could really make a mark – or at least you could if you were any good. And <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160423032506/http://www.macuser.co.uk/\">MacUser</a> lived on its exclusives, on stories which other Mac publications didn’t even get a sniff of. We prided ourselves on getting stories which companies really didn’t want to be published. Our duty was the readers, and we were <em>fierce</em> about getting the truth for them. If it was revealing a new product’s upcoming release, thus killing off sales of a previous model, so what? We’d saved our readers from buying a dud. If that company then got so outraged at our behaviour they pulled advertising, then fuck ’em – whether you advertised or not didn’t get you any influence on the editorial. Companies knew it, too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>How do you get the stories before anyone else? By gossiping. By understanding that reporting is about people, relationships, who you know, how you talk to them. We bandy around the phrase “cultivating sources”, but all that means is getting to know people and getting them to trust you. Never selling sources down the river, but always being aware of what someone is telling you and why they are telling you.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>I’m reminded of all this by the death of David Carr. Carr wasn’t just an average reporter: he got under the skin of his chosen beat, and knew that reporting was fundamentally about people. Watch Carr at work in “<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160423032506/https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_One:_Inside_the_New_York_Times\">Page One</a>”, the documentary which is nominally about his employer but which turns quickly into the David Carr Show. Look at the way he talks on the phone, the easy venom which he drips on the hapless founders of Vice, who, despite their supposed new media smarts, come across like amateurs. This is a man who understands journalism is about people. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160423032506/http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/13/business/media/david-carr-a-journalist-at-the-center-of-the-sweet-spot.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=second-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news\">As his colleague A. O. Scott puts it</a>:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>“What else?” was the question that would punctuate every conversation with him. What were you working on? What did you think of this or that political event, show-business caper or piece of office gossip? How was your family? What were you thinking? This was sincere, friendly curiosity, the expression of a naturally gregarious temperament. But it was also the operation of a tireless journalistic instinct. David was always hungry for stories. He was a collector of personalities and anecdotes, a shrewd and compassionate judge of character. A warrior for the truth.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n</blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The fundamental thing about journalism remains the same as it’s been for a hundred years: <em>Whatever you do, get the story.</em> Everything else is ancillary. And stories come from, and are about, people. Remember that the next time some journalistic pundit with a safe job in a university calls publishing “a technology business”.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:footnotes /-->\n",
